80     | At first, I have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose. Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn‚Äôt have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn‚Äôt have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book. I love to read in the park.

587     | My baby won't take any brand of pacifier. That being said, he loves to get put the toy in his mouth my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kitten is tiny (think beanie baby in a happy meal size). In their defense it did say kitten, not cat. Touch√©. If buy another one, I'm buying a giraffe.

947     | I wish I could give this zero stars. Bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel. Every appliance I own is LG, washer and dryer included. Luckily, they still work. I work ALL the time and prefer my food grilled. I rarely use the microwave. Just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers. My microwave died today. Just stopped heating. Everything else apparently works on it. Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews. She was basically like yeah, ok, do you want me to find you a service center? At the end of our conversation, she just ended the session. I wasnt finished chatting with her. I will NEVER buy an LG appliance<br /><br />Chat log:<br />Chat Transcript<br />Time of chat: 7/2/2015 4:54:35 PM<br />Length of chat: 00:18:41<br />Your name: rafael vazquez<br />Chatted with: Michelle, Paulsen<br /><br />4:54 PM Michelle: Hello rafael vazquez.

1882     | The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it will not stick to my vanity which is made out of wood. It won‚Äôt hold in place after I place the blow dryer. Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).

2006     | My newborn girl loves this pacifier.¬† The first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home, since the one they give are the standart blue with MAM written on it, I wanted something cute for my girl, so I bought from another brand that looked way nicer, but my baby wouldn't take it, so I checked online and found these and I love that they're exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute.

2283     | this bottle newborn feeding set is the best! my daughter loves all dr.brown¬¥s bottles! the bottle reduces the air intake in the child's mouth and prevents colic!
2369     | These funny little pacifier/animal combos have been a lifesaver! They generally stay in baby‚Äôs mouth a little longer than a standard pacifier and give her something to hold on to. The attached pacifier is a Soothie, which is the only type of pacifier our daughter would take. I also got a few extra Soothies to stick in the diaper bag for emergencies. Not to mention these Wubbanubs look adorable! Our favorite is the giraffe. (If you ever happen to run into him, ours is named Carl). This was featured on my Top 10 Items for Baby list!

3449     | This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldn‚Äôt believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets.
3830     | Best dryer ever.<br />I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I'm on my 2nd one of these in 3 years‚Ä¶ I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I've ever had.
3860     | My baby would not take a pacifier (from birth to now, 6 months) yet had a very strong suck/chew desire.  A friend (pediatrician) gave us one of these as a shower gift.  My son LOVES it.  He chews/sucks on it from all angles and it sooths him like nothing else. The pacifier is very well attached, I inspect it daily and it is not loosening or wearing at all.  We ordered this second one so we would have a spare.<br />Highly recommend! Buy it! It‚Äôs the best 15 bucks we have spent.
3874     | Let me say first, shipping and such was amazing. I ordered these on a Friday night and received them on a Sunday! I don't know if anyone else ever received mail on a Sunday from the USPS but it was a first for me and it was amazing to get it so quickly. Now the product; exactly what I expected to receive. I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are üòä) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.
3898     | this bag is very beautiful and doesn‚Äôt look like a diaper bag at all. the nylon material seems very durable and easy to clean. bottle  pockets on both sides of the bag  are insulated. i put on of the bottles for example  and you can see it on one of the pictures (i use playtex drop-in bottles).<br /><br />in front of the bag there are two pockets. the lower one can fit full size wallet and there still will be some space on the side. the top pocket could be perfect for cell phone or small items (i would use it for my personal things ), and to give you an idea how big it is on one of the pictures i put facial wipes mustela in it. once the wipes are in i am able to close the pocket but the top part of the wipe‚Äôs container sometimes gets on the way. also, zipper on this particular pocket is hard to work with. what i mean is that you will need to use two hand to close it. i think it because the placed zipper so high to the top of the bag.<br /><br />on the back of the bag there is a zipped compartment for changing pad. it‚Äôs a  standard size for skip hop brand  and i believe no bigger or smaller than most others.<br /><br />on the inside there are four pockets that are the same size. you might see from the picture that pockets are reinforced, which i love, because it hold things more secure. it doesn‚Äôt have bottle pockets on the inside of the bag. also, i like the color of the inside ‚Äì its not black so you can find things easier, but not too light to show dirt.  the stroller hooks can be placed on the inside of the bag  when not in use.<br /><br />my other favorite part is ‚Äì the bag has zipper on top! i don‚Äôt have to worry about everything flying out of the bag when i throw it in the car. the stroller hooks can be used even when the bag is closed, another big plus.<br /><br />the hardware is color of yellow gold, and as much as i dislike the yellow gold this particular tone doesn‚Äôt bother me.<br />the handles are very comfy.<br /><br />overall i would highly recommend  this bag to anybody who, like me, is looking for a diaper bag that doesn‚Äôt look like it. it is very roomy even if it doesn‚Äôt look like it. i was between this one and storksak .  skip hop holds same amount or even more and looks nicer.<br />but i do have my concerns: zippers would ne first one (i noticed when you place something in the front pocket it a little easier to close),  i wish the handles were from nylon material instead of faux leather ‚Äì would last longer, the same can be said about details ‚Äì i am not sure how long the faux leather will last, i also wish skip hop would add a shoulder strap (but it‚Äôs just personal preference)
4022     | tried many pacifiers, and this one was the only one that stuck until the baby was ¬±5mo. highly recommended for newborn.
4241     | Love this, I haven't actually used it on my hair yet but my poodles hair is very nice and frizz free. ‚úå‚ù§
4338     | I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. üòä

4889     | So disappointed with a recent order of these pacifiers. My newest baby had been using one from two years ago (2012) that my older child never used. We love the old one‚Äîsturdy, thick, quality rubber, darker amber color, matte look/feel, perfectly molded. Though after 3 months of consistent use it has started to wear down/disintegrate. But this new 2-pack I just received is nothing like the ones from two years ago. They're cheap feeling, flimsy, thinner, shiny, the edges are ragged with extra rubber pieces. I'm so let down because we've loved our old Natursutten SO much! The old one is so rich looking. The new style is no better than the cheap ones from the grocery store. Sad.
5047     | This was the only paci one of my kids would take. Just had another little one a few days ago and he has already taken to this with zero issuesüòä
5532     | These are my favorite pacifiers. I especially love these for night because they glow in the dark and are easy to find when you‚Äôre trying to put a upset baby back to bed.
5847     | the bottles had scratches all over it, as if someone had used them and returned it. i don‚Äôt want to use someone else bottles for my baby. i just threw them out and got new bottles from walmart.
5849     | A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! üòâ<br />THANKS AMAZON!
5933     | I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn‚Äôt work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say ‚Äúultra-lightweight‚Äù). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn‚Äôt need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to ‚Äúset‚Äù the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn‚Äôt have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn‚Äôt out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She‚Äôs always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*
5992     | It's a good hair dryer the attachment just won't stay on üòí
6115     | Everyone that comes over comments: ‚ÄúWHERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!‚Äù it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it‚Äôs easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it‚Äôs holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.<br />I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn‚Äôt have to drill holes. It‚Äôs holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it‚Äôs mount and work with it directly. Great buy
6282     | Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs Caf√© Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave.
6341     | I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways‚Ä¶ This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions‚Ä¶. but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice‚Ä¶. if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.
6446     | this may be the worst baby monitor out there.  i initially received this one as a audience member at a talk show.  i thought score!  except when i go to plug it in, it never turns on.  it takes me a good 45minutes to figure out their website and how to contact someone to help me with the issue (every link would give me an error and not go through).  once i did reach someone - they were very good about emailing me and calling me, and agreed to send me a new one (under warranty), once i send them my monitor back.  so there i am‚Ä¶.monitor-less for a good month.<br /><br />i get the second one. it plugs in. it turns on.  except it keeps going out of service.  and it can't decide between nighttime or day time vision.  (and the nighttime isn't that great on this monitor - it's not very detailed‚Ä¶it's almost fuzzy.)  and then the entire unit just goes fuzzy and broken up.  so there i go again - contacting levana - and they send me a new one (a month later), once i send the unit back first (and that they receive it)<br /><br />i finally receive the third monitor.  and it works ok for 5 months or so. never perfect, but good enough.  one day it starts fuzzing again and blacking out.  this time, i have levana send me a unit before i send mine back.<br /><br />i received the new levana - and this one keeps going in and out of service - and this monitor is always in the same spot!<br /><br /> i finally gave up and purchased the motorola one.
6449     | This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It‚Äôs powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.
6512     | supportive and it prevents my daughter‚Äôs neck from moving back and forth while she‚Äôs sleeping. i love the fact it‚Äôs completely smooth one side and soft and furry on the other. my daughter prefers the smooth side; overall we are very pleased with this purchase.
6805     | what i like most about these thermos containers is that the liquid will stay cold for a long time. i haven‚Äôt tested exactly how long. but i live in southern california and it can get very hot here. i will put water with ice in these and leave the house with the kids around 9 am and the water is still cold when we eat lunch around 1 pm. while i do not use this for milk or juice, i can see that these would work well to carry milk out of the house for later.<br /><br />they are easy to clean and i like they are not made of plastic. i believe the straw parts are silicone ‚Äì this is great if your kids tend to chew on the straw like mine do. these are very durable. it is a little hard to take apart sometimes for cleaning, but once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs fine. this is dishwasher safe, although the cap would likely melt if it falls into the heating unit of your dishwasher.<br /><br />the top has three parts: the plastic lid, the straw that goes in your mouth and the long tube to reach for the liquid. my husband tends to forget to add the straw ‚Äì and without it you cannot drink! this cup is very durable. it will leak if your child shakes it, holds it upside down and sometimes it may splash a drop when popped open. but because i use this for water it isn't a problem as it has not proved to be at all messy. but i would not recommend for younger toddlers that shake their cups. these [[asin:b00ohkrm5a playtex playtime straw sippy cup, super friends, 9 ounce]] worked really well when my kids were younger.
6873     | I used this dryer for the first time at a friend‚Äôs house.  It was amazing, it had the attachment on it and my hair was silky and dry within minutes.  I was so thrilled with it; I went online and bought one.  I still love it and the best part about the dryer is the warm setting.  You can dry your hair right at your scalp and not burn your head or heat up the bathroom to the point where you're sweating!!  I highly recommend this dryer.  I have had this dryer now for 6 months.
7016     | Avent is the brand I have used with my two kids, the third is on the way and I didn¬¥t doubt keeping working with Avent.
7124     | It¬¥s ok for a new born but for my 5 months old its too soft. I bought it for him to sleep at night and hold on to something (he love to have something for comforting) but this item never work. My recommend is to buy it for 0-3 mos.
7359     | i ordered a set of the regular spill spoiler caps at the same time as i ordered a set of the sport caps.  i am equally pleased with both, so this review mirrors my comments on the sport caps.<br /><br />i drink nutritional drinks and energy drinks in the car and at home, and have a tendency to be a klutz and spill whatever i am drinking in the car and on the furniture.  when i happened onto the spill spoiler ad, i  ordered a set of the regular caps and a set of the sport caps.<br /><br />up-front, i will say i was very pleased to see a listing of the types and brands of bottles each cap fits.  i didn‚Äôt have to wonder if the cap would fit my particular drink bottle.<br /><br />upon receipt of the caps, i immediately tried them and found they do exactly what the ad says.  unscrew the drink‚Äôs regular cap, screw on the spill spoiler cap, stick in a straw, and you are ready to go.  pull out the straw and the hole closes and your drink doesn‚Äôt spill.  at the end of the day (or whenever), just put the cap into the dishwasher and it is ready to go again.<br /><br />i am elated to have found the spill spoiler.  since i am not only klutzy, but also have been known to lose things, i am going to order another one or two sets of each cap.  they work. i recommend them to anyone who drinks and spills things, and that is everyone.
7375     | love the mat!  so happy about the purchase.  rolls up, very light and travels easily.  we take it to other people's houses and on vacations (haven't taken it on the plane yet).  awesome on vacation because you don't want your baby crawling and playing around on gross hotel room carpet.  perfect size.  cover washes great and easy to get on.  it also is a great neutral color that works well with the d√©cor of most rooms.  it works great on rugs, tile and wood floors.  i've never seen it slip on tile.<br /><br />note - i saw some reviews saying that the cover was hard to get back on once it had been washed but i completely disagree.  super easy and i'm usually terrible with stuff like that.  i wash it once a week and i've never had a problem.<br /><br />recommendations to manufacturer: (1) sell replacement covers so i can use the mat while the i'm washing the cover, (2) maybe offer a bigger mat option if people want to fill up an entire room.  a more permanent mat solution.<br /><br />the only con is the price.  very expensive for a play mat but worth it.  organic, high quality and made in the usa.  would purchase a dozen more if i could!!
7474     | I absolutely adore this company‚Ä¶.. Two of my cousins just had babies and I bought them both this product‚Ä¶. They loved them. Nicely done‚Ä¶.perfect shower gift. Shipping with amazon prime was super fast and everything was packaged well.  VERY VERY NICE PRODUCT!!!!! And ever so cute!!! ~~~ caitie xoxox
7479     | these bags are awesome. i keep them on the changing table and use them for soiled diapers. i used to use the diaper genie, but i hated leaving smelly diapers in the room until the container was filled. this way i just throw the diapers away as they are used.  i also keep them in my diaper bag. i've used them numerous times for wet or dirty clothesüòâ
7525     | Best baby product ever. The weight of the animal keeps the pacifier closer to my baby's mouth during sleep. She loves clutching the animal and holding it herself‚Äîa good item to help with basic motor skills.
7661     | at first i liked the product, although the audio quality has always been poor‚Ä¶but after 3 months the camera stopped working and it is useless.
7685     | this is not a body pillow‚Ä¶.i highly recommend the full size leachco.  this was not very useful to me as it didn't offer me the support or comfort that the full size pillow does----which is all around comfort.  this one may be convenient for naps on the sofa but def not for a long slumber.  the pattern is much nicer on the mini than the large.
7837     | cute idea!  Mommy & Daddy-to-be were impressed with it and goes well the theme & d√©cor of baby's room! Fast delivery and in good shape-was here in plenty of time for shower!
7966     | excelente producto, exacto al que ofrecen, lo esperado, adaptado para el bebe, colores estupendos, tama√±o muy acorde, llegada muy rapida.
8010     | I haven't tried these out on my baby yet (due to him not being born yet); however, the pacifiers that I received do not look like the ones shown. They're a solid color rather than the striped - which I had really liked and anticipated. I ordered these for my fianc√©'s birthday, which is coming up, otherwise I'd return them. They're not horrible, just not what I had expected.
8550     | I want to clarify that I did not buy this microwave from Amazon (we bought it during a sale at Home Depot)  I hope this review will serve to caution anyone who is interested in Whirlpool products to buy a different brand or at least buy an extended warranty. We owned the microwave for 1 year and 3 months before the magnetron went out (the manufacturers warranty was for 1 yr and opted NOT to buy the extended warranty).  I understand that modern appliances don't last forever and that some parts may break on a high usage item (handles, knobs, etc).  What I have problem with is when the part that makes it a microwave lasts only one year‚Ä¶on an item I paid approximately $275 for.  When I contacted Whirlpool, they offered to sell me an extended warranty and advised me of the charge for the part and labor to replace it.  Home Depot tried calling Whirlpool Customer Service on my behalf, but hit the same brick wall I did.  I am sure most moderately priced appliances have roughly the same &#34;shelf life&#34;, but I did expect a $275 product to last a bit longer than 15 month.  Either I bought a lemon or there is a conspiracy to get people to pay more for an extended warranty...
8633     | i bought one of these and tested today for the first time.<br /><br />i became very happy with the smart two way communication of this device. beyond the fact of the product allow the parents to talk to the baby over voice, it turns off the infrared lights of the camera when you are not viewing the baby!<br /><br />normally i don¬¥t like motorola products, but this is over my spectations!<br /><br />thank you amazon.com!
9004     | This was the perfect size for my friend‚Äôs Robyn‚Äôs baby.  She is going on three months old but was a tiny preemie.  Like a dog sniffing a bone, Baby Annaleigh played with it a while before suckling the passie.  The pacifier is contoured for great sucking support.<br /><br />The pack has two pacifier in it for $6 bucks which is a pretty good price, but I do not like the $9 in shipping.  I don‚Äôt know what BPA-free and is dishwasher safe.
9221     | My daughter only uses a binky to sleep or calm herself since birth (and now still at 6mos).  She was always dropping them and we had to put one back in her hand or mouth, constantly!  We tried straps too which helped us find the binky but was no use for her.  We also didn‚Äôt want to put her in the crib with anything with straps/clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.  We‚Äôve had both for 4 months and no visible wear and bodies are still solidly stitched.
9294     | It¬¥s a great pacifier, my daughter like it. Howewer, if you want to buy it because it glows at night, just buy the regulars, the glow doesn't last more than 6 minutes.
9692     | I have been using the product for my son. So ƒ± am happy to be able to get it as i have not found it in my country.
9831     | these sheets are pretty awesome! the bottom sheet is fitted, which is expected. but then, the top sheet has fitted pockets on both corners; so you don't have to do hospital corners! that is absolutely a huge deal when you're dealing with a toddler bed that has rails or bars on two of the three sides down at the foot. the pockets keep the top sheet right in place!!! i want that in my california king sheets!!!! now to the drawbacks: they wrinkle seriously. the material is not soft. i was disappointed that the top sheet is reversed. they are a little too high priced. i don‚Äôt know how well they will hold up after multiple washing ‚Äì but i‚Äôm hoping they are as awesome as the fitted pockets!!
9949     | These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take. They are molded symmetrically‚Äã so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down, it is still the same shape, and she is still happy.
10108     | love all the britax brand car seats‚Ä¶.easy to use, dependable, durable. my son is two and been a beating, but when he's older, we will buy the britax booster, and when the new baby is due, we will buy another infant car seat from britax. we drive in a busy seat breaking hard, swerving and he just sleeps!
10895     | The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn‚Äôt bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I‚Äôve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn‚Äôt completely soundless but it isn‚Äôt obnoxiously loud compared to others I‚Äôve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn‚Äôt as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.
11547     | I thought i was going to recieve these adorable paci's that was shown one having a car and the other having a plane on it i was so excited!! Until i opend them....one had a motorcycle and the other a lions faceüòî i never seen that option listed...
11731     | i always eyed this rattle in the baby toy aisle, but was skeptical it was worth $4. found it for 50¬¢ and decided to get it, and i wish i had never hesitated! my 3.5 month old grips the cross-style body easily and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys. the mirror side makes the balls seem to glow and always catches eye. this and his take along tunes have been his diaper-bag-must-haves.
12437     | these pouches are surprisingly easy to clean. the seal is tight and my toddler has yet discovered how to open them - i doubt he could if he tried. this is a great, mess-free way to get little babies/toddlers to eat food that you otherwise wouldn't let them eat on their own without making a mess (i.e yogurt, applesauce, pur√©es). my son takes it to preschool and it always comes back empty. love it!
12692     | some of the toys are ok, one broke when i cleaned it so my daughter never got to use it and another broke into pieces 5 min after i handed it to her, she is only 5 months, so she didn't need a lot of power to brake it.<br />but what can you expect when you buy 6 toys for 6$? üòù
12828     | amazing natural product !<br />i used it on my baby for 2 months and its fabulous !  he has smooth skin & rash is gone..<br />it also moisturises extremelty well ! my baby loves it !!<br />thank you &#34;la petite cr√®me&#34;<br />happy baby , happy mommy ! üòä
12854     | Works pretty well, but I've been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer‚Ä¶ which I didn't have to do before, but now if I don't, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.
13018     | ok i like these a lot but i would liked them even more if i got the i‚ù§Ô∏èhealthy something's. instead we got i‚ù§Ô∏ècookies/ice cream/ french fries. would have liked the bananas/peas or avocado instead.
13239     | just used the go glass bottle for the first time and love it!! more importantly my one month old loves it! super cute as well üòÑ easy to clean definitely recommend üëçüèª
13440     | Love it! Go LSU Tigers! üòä
13471     | My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I‚Äôm good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it.
13516     | my granddaughter even she is 9 yr old still love dinosairs and its really hard to find d√©cor for this age group and specialy for girls .this product really brought nice &#34;dino&#34; touch. lol she is happy and so do i.
13580     | great ‚ÄºÔ∏è
13816     | i am very pleased with this product, it cleans easily, easy to install, very durable, keeps the back seats clean from scuff marks. i'm also pleased with the built in pockets for organization ability. üòä
14157     | Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I'm in love üòçüòçüòç
14216     | it looks nice at the beginning, but just after a few uses the closing mechanism broke‚Ä¶.doesn¬¥t make any sense.  poor quality product.
14298     | Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz
14318     | FOR THE MONEY ITS FINE‚Ä¶KIND OF SMALL. POWERFULL. DESIGN AND COLOR ARE GREAT.CORD IS SHORT TOO‚Ä¶DONT BE FAR FROM OUT-LET
14650     | i have had this highchair for a few months and wish i did more research before buying. the cover does not come off so you can't wash it and wiping it down is not enough. also, you need 2 hands to put the tray on. the tray usually doesn't allign right and takes some time to get it right. i thought the highchair came with a 5 point harness but does not. my baby slides and falls to the side while eating. this causes her discomfort since her arm gets all red from being pinned to the side or stuck hanging over the chair. wishing i bought another highchair üòï
14904     | As a bald man, I love this hair dryer. It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Ky≈çf≈´, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is f√∂hn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the &#34;lifeline shock protection&#34;. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary.
14909     | We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200¬∞ F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300¬∞ F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price. Once ours busts I will most likely purchase another Revlon.
14932     | With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.<br /><br />I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.<br /><br />According to the packaging, this product is known for being:<br /><br />POWERFUL ‚Äì Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini‚Äôs salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair<br />PRECISE ‚Äì The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting<br />ADJUSTABLE ‚Äì With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button<br />LIGHT WEIGHT ‚Äì Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users<br /><br />Overall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn‚Äôt get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.<br /><br />This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.
14984     | PACIFIER ITSELF IS TOO HARD. THE STUFFED ANIMAL THOUGH IS CUTE. MY NEWBORN NEVER LIKED IT. MAYBE HER MOUTH WAS TOO SMALL IDK....but its ¬™ great teether tho.. Soothed her gums while she was cutting teeth
15053     | we loved the idea of this keepsake case for our baby book. thought it would be perfect to store the c.r. gibson baby book perfectly and keep it neat and tidy for years to come! we purchased the exact c.r. gibson baby book as pictured with the keepsake case in the stock photo. the keepsake case is way too small to accommodate the baby book, even when empty and not filled with memories, photos, ect. we did keep it, thinking it would be a nice place to keep photos, baby band from the hospital, well wishes, act from her early months‚Ä¶ but i would not recommend this product if wanting to use to keep that particular c.r. baby book inside.
15350     | I am extremely happy that I purchased this hair dryer!  I have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30-35 minutes.  It does get pretty hot so I suggest a setting around 50 ‚Äì 55.  It‚Äôs very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow.  I do have to say, the first thing my husband said when he saw it was ‚Äúare you going to the moon?‚Äù ‚Äì as it does look like a space helmet.  The directions are not very clear but I managed to put it together just fine by myself and it‚Äôs very sturdy.  I definitely would recommend this dryer.
15994     | The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! üòí
16074     | this is one of those products that change the way you live. we got this when our baby was 3.5 months old and she took to it immediately. she is now almost 7 months old. it is comfortable for both baby and her caregiver, whomever it may be at the time. my mil, husband, babysitter, and i are all different heights (153 cm to 172 cm) and different sizes (50 kg to 83 kg) and this carrier can adjust to fit us all comfortably. there are many things i love about this carrier.<br /><br />pros:<br />- the biggest pro for us is the mesh cooling vent. the daily temperature here averages 28¬∞c to 35¬∞c with tropical humidity. while you're never going to be completely cool while carrying baby, the mesh makes it much more comfortable to do so.<br />- did i mention how comfortable it is to use? the wide waist belt provides loads of support and the shoulder straps are thick & padded. i like that you can wear the waist strap higher (on the waist) or lower (resting on the hips) to adjust for baby's height. i love having my baby within kissing distance!<br />- comfortable for baby! she's snug as a bug in a rug and regularly falls asleep while still in the carrier. the inward-facing design doesn't seem to bother her as she can still see out the sides (outward-facing carriers are not good for baby's development). in fact, she seems to prefer being high up in the carrier as she has a better view rather than being in her stroller.<br />- the sleeping hood is generously cut and is large enough to accommodate even a tall toddler. the way the hood is designed means that there are no strings or straps that can cut into baby's face. the straps to fasten the hood are attached to it and it all rolls neatly into provided front pocket. there are no dangling strings or buckles to get in the way. we've used the hood to help her sleep, keep the sun off her face and to keep the rain off her head.<br />- the front pocket is not very large, especially with the hood already tucked into it. however there is enough space to tuck some keys, cash and a phone if all you're doing is going for a walk or a quick run to the store.<br />- easier and more convenient than a stroller. we no longer take our graco stroller on outings now. having to take a stroller was so cumbersome and unwieldy, especially in crowds. the stroller also took up all the space in the trunk. now we just put baby in her carrier, grab the ju ju be bff and we're ready to go.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the care instructions state that it is best to avoid washing the carrier and to spot clean only. this has something to do with the organic dye used on the fabric and is supposed to help keep the carrier looking new. this is not a huge issue for me but i can imagine it being a big deal for some others. i highly recommend buying the drool pads and using them with the carrier from the very beginning to avoid getting any stains on it.<br />- no way to attach anything to the carrier. i would have liked to have a d-ring or two on the carrier so that a toy / pacifier can be attached to it and within reach the moment it is needed. imo this is something small that would be a great improvement to the utility of the carrier.<br /><br />overall, a great product and well worth the money spent!

16402     | Works exactly as advertised in my GE Profile microwave. Color match is darned near exact. I prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible. Then sprayed in many coats to get coverage. I removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips‚Äîcould just as easily remove a star from the painter (me). The paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth. Nonetheless, I will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the GE oven. Cleans nicely, and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />1 can will likely cover about ¬Ω of a microwave interior adequately. Since my oven was flaking, I needed about this much coverage or slightly less. If I had stripped the entire interior, I would have been short.

16898     | Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy too‚Ä¶and gets a 5 star rating!

17231     | I've had this dryer for 2 ¬Ω years. The latch that keeps the hood upright has finally warped and doesn't stand open. Otherwise, it heats nicely and evenly and the Ion feature leaves my hair shiny. It was so good that I refuse to buy another. I just rigged it with some flexi-rods to get the hood to stay open and upright. Yep, it's just that good.

17955     | This may or may not be a solution for you but it worked for me.<br />My SMH8165ST was purchased in January of 2012. In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 ¬Ω months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician‚Äôs tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.
18403     | love the glasses.  i purchased them for my 22 month old grandchild, and they are unbreakable, the first challenge they went through was being twisted around and they made it.  good price also.üòä
18596     | i am pretty thrilled with this bike trailer. i use it more as a jogger, but my man and i have both taken our 20-month-old around in it as a trailer, and we all love it.<br /><br />best points:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ assembly and breaking down for storage is a snap. button-release tires and simple-yet-sophisticated folding make it quick to deal with. (keep in mind, though, that it's designed around utility, so it's going to take a little longer than your average street stroller. the first time, as with most new gadgets, takes a bit longer, too.)<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the cabin is very spacious, and will handily accommodate our child's long torso as he grows.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ storage 'trunk' behind the seating and pockets in the cabin hold plenty. there's lots of foot room, so i often put things at my son's feet, too.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the rigid floor is excellent. it supports his feet and keeps his legs more comfortable than the soft-floored ones can.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the feature that i love most isn't mentioned in the manual at all, i assume for legal reasons. there are leg holes under the handle that render it into a shopping-cart-style seat, so when we're out for a long time, and my son has had enough of looking forward on his own, he can join me as i push it along. this feature alone is priceless. it has saved the day countless times already in the few months we've had it. there is no harness, so i am very careful, and i would never take my hands off it when he's there, but it is well designed. it seems insubstantial, but holds him very well. (it helps to have some cargo in the front, for balance.)<br /><br />‚Ä¢ it is undeniably handsome. i probably wouldn't have chosen the bright yellow if there had been more options, but it is cheerful and easy to look at. it is also easy to see, which makes it safer.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ it is vented. most of the time, we keep the bug screen and window open and stowed, so ventilation isn't much of an issue, but in rain or cooler weather, the vent underthe handle is terrific. to keep airflow going, i zip the window down on both sides, but tuck the bottom inch or two up next to the screen.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ soft seat means with two riders, they'll squish toward the middle. it's easy to fix by adding something rigid underneath. when his buddy comes along, that's what we do, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the back of a bike helmet pushes the child's head forward, which must be uncomfortable. i got no complaint from my little guy, but i'm thinking of a way to fix it, because it bugs me.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ while i wouldn't call it heavy, i've seen other bike trailers out there that are tiny and look featherlight. anyone who spends much time on a bike knows how much weight matters. it's easy enough to haul around, but its features and size mean that it's no fun coming across  a stop sign when you're starting up a hill with two kids in the trailer.<br /><br />all in all, this is a superb piece of equipment.
18800     | anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.<br /><br />*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn't quite follow .... üòâ<br /><br />So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.
18801     | i love these packets! they are so easy to use and i love that i can throw them in the dishwasher and the freezer. they make baby-food pur√©e storing a breeze! i want to buy more!!

19021     | For some time now I've been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and I have finally found it!! I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62¬∞F and the hottest is approximately 223¬∞F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!
19425     | We tried different styles and brands before and she didn¬¥t like them. But she likes this a lot. It works so she stops crying when there is nothing else to do.
19570     | After our GE Caf√© microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
19604     | The bonnet hair dryer is fabulousüíê.  It's so lightweight.  I can dry my curls and read a book in ease. Absolutely love it.
19606     | Great little pacifiers that are similar to the Soothies but supposed to stay closer to the babies face, so they slip out less. I can't say whether they actually do slip out less‚Ä¶ Seems about the same.The only thought I have is that they cut a little  Low on the babies lip so part of the lip is sticking over the pacifier. The feeling would annoying me, but I guess doesn't seem to bother the baby too much
19757     | I purchased this for traveling, and like that it has both diffuser and concentrator attachments.  I wish it had a cool setting but I can live without it for he price I paid‚Äîalthough I see it's come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value.  The storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered.  I checked out some mini hairdryers that cost up to 5 times as much‚Äîno way for something I may use 3 times in a year.<br /><br />I just wish t had a flat diffuser without the &#34;teeth&#34; ‚Äî I used to have that kind and prefer it.
19842     | I purchased the WubbaNub Giraffe for my 3 month old as a possible solution to his pacifier falling out as he‚Äôs falling asleep and him rooting around to find it and waking himself up. I saw the negative reviews and had concerns but all the positive reviews swayed me and I took a leap of faith to purchase.<br /><br />Well it arrived in super-fast time thanks to Amazon Prime, however the Giraffe and pacifier are so poor quality I‚Äôm returning immediately.<br /><br />The packaging arrived intact, though it looked a cheaply printed, I‚Äôve never seen these in stores but would love to compare packaging to check if this is authentic. The pacifier part is a joke. It‚Äôs tiny and not the standard AVENT soothie given to you at the hospital or that you can buy in stores. My main concern was that without opening the packaging, I could see that the giraffe body had holes in it and the stuffing was coming out. The stitching along the spine of the giraffe was very shoddy and loose and would fall apart within days, if not sooner.<br /><br />This item is potentially a serious choking hazard and SHOULD NOT be sold for babies or children. Amazon needs to stop selling these or at least verify quality/supplier. Maybe a few year's ago this was a good quality item but based on recent reviews on Amazon something has changed.
19912     | este secador es peque√±o liviano muy ligero es bueno. ojo no es par mi, es para mi esposa y a ella le gusto mucho y mas le gusto porque fue un regalo de mi parte...  comprenlo con los hojos serrados
20282     | It is greatÔºÅ
20283     | At about 15 days old, I gave in and tried a pacifier. It was a larger Nuk that someone gave as a gift‚Äîat the time I had no idea there were sizes for these things. After a day or two, our daughter seemed to &#34;latch&#34; with this and I got a nice long nap. Since it seemed to work well for her, I decided to come here to Amazon and order a few (and discovered the Newborn and other size options).<br /><br />Because I had her on a larger one previously, these &#34;Newborn&#34; pacifiers were immediately useless, as she would seemingly not even notice there was something to suck on and it would fall out of her mouth. The larger one we had gotten as a gift has a cover than closes when it falls, but my wife doesn't like that because she thinks it will leave a mark. I don't even know the size, so I am going to experiment and order some more now. Hopefully we'll get the right one.<br /><br />If you've used standard latex feeding nipples, these may not work for your baby at all because they are too small.
20389     | If there were more stars to give I would!  The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are √ºber nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting/baby shower/new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...
20694     | there is nothing better than looking back and seeing your little one safe and sound. rear facing is ideal for longer than most are aware. often times babies are turned around sooner than they should be because moms and dads are trying to keep an eye on them, or can‚Äôt see them, or their kiddo wants to see them. for their safety it‚Äôs best to keep them rear facing as long as possible and having a quality baby mirror makes that a bit easier to do.<br /><br />they made a mirror that has a clear view, and lets you see your precious baby in their safe rear facing car seat. the view is so clear that your baby will not have a difficult time seeing you as well.<br /><br />this baby mirror was super easy to install, and can be used with almost every vehicle as far as i can tell. the design provides for a large visible space, it is not heavy or bulky. i love affordable, quality baby items. if you don‚Äôt have a little one, you might consider buying one of these for someone you know who will be having a little one soon or has one! i think the design is actually really cute, and the soft rounded edges seem more appealing to me.<br /><br />**i received a free product for a review. my opinions are 100% honest and my own.**
20713     | It's adorable and the little bear does help the pacifier from flying out of my newborns mouth.  And if she does manage to accidentally spit it out, I've seen her nibbling on his legs üòä
21072     | I've been using this dryer 3-4 times a week for about 3 months now.  The Infiniti is quieter, smaller (about 6&#34; high and 5 ¬æ&#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a champ.<br />  This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I'd be willing to toss my flat-iron.  I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.<br />  I'm a satisfied customer :)
21930     | The item is great. Strudy and all. Perfect size for two pacifiers and a convenient loop to attach it to the stroller. My only concern is... PINK? From all the colors I could have received I got PINK! For a boy! No way. I¬¥m using it anyway but keeping it inside the diaper bag. Pink! :P

22325     | I‚Äòm going to have baby this September. i want to take some picture of him when he using this thing. Just not sure it's safety enough.
22343     | I bought it for my Girlfriend (We are angry with each other for now) or possible Ex-girlfriend (If you are reading this review too late) and I've got to say that It¬¥s a very good Hair Dryer... She seems (At this moment) enjoy it... And She looks very happy with it... No complaints... Great product... Good price... 100% Recommended.
22414     | After reading several answers to my question about whether this dryer has 2 or 3 fan speeds, I decided to go ahead and buy it at a retail store.  I can tell you definitively that it has 3 heat settings, but only 2 fan settings.  The only difference between the medium and high settings is the temperature that blows out.  The fan speeds are actually low and medium.  It turns out that this worked out fine for me, because I wanted a dryer that didn‚Äôt feel like a hurricane while trying to style my short hair.<br /><br />People with long, thick hair probably won‚Äôt like this dryer because it doesn‚Äôt have a real powerful fan speed.  May I recommend for you guys the Conair 1875 Watt Ion Shine Hair Styler.  That dryer has 2 fan speeds, one is a gentle breeze, the other a virtual hurricane, but I bet it dries long hair in a jiffy.  I have relegated that dryer to the closet, perhaps to dry hand-washed clothes or something like that.

23764     | This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)‚Ä¶so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But‚Ä¶I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

24096     | About Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ electric toothbrush by Arm & Hammer.  So I was trying to figure out how to change the battery/s for this toothbrush --- for a long time - lol too long! And I was feelin' a bit dumb (lol). I had  always had a problem with the switch with the  Arm & Hammer Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ. tooth brush - it was easy to turn on but it was actually a puzzle (not intuitive, to me anyway) to shut off. LOL - I knew the design of this T/Brush had out smarted me in the past so putting ego aside I went to the Web with my problem and to the Electric Tooth Brush Manufacture's site [...] by Arm & Hammer. I must say this is Very FLASH-e Web Site. (lol) Very typical, over the top - big company stuff! Designed for the Suit Client not the Toothbrush Customer. The web sit does not have a Site Search Field, I knew I was in for it right then!  YES there is a Q & A page but there is a lame Ask Us page that is really just a badly titled where to buy landing page., ([...]). It seems like you need to go two levels of pages in on this site to discover this page link found on the ASK US PAGE: [...] On the  FAQ page, How to change the battery for this model Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ was an unanswered question, others yes full and complete How To's, but not for this model! Curious? Which led me to Amazon to see what others knew about the Arm & (and) Hammer Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ. I found my answer at Amazon. It seems instead of just saying that you have to toss this thing in the landfill where it will last for who know's how long the A&H approach is omission. Just not talking about the issue with their customers? It was almost like they were too embarrassed to put in writing the truth about such an un-ecofriendly electric tooth brush. Lessons I learned: I wasted a lot of time, I found the solution to my problem very quickly on Amazon, & I got what I paid for when I bought the cheapest Electric Toothbrush I could find. I am embarrassed to put this in the garbage but that's where it is.

25034     | muy util para limpiar la nariz del bebe, lo unico es que hay que tener cuidado con el recipiente deposito de fluidos, el mismo es un poco delicado en el sistema de cerrado, se rompen las pesta√±as y queda impedido para mantener el deposito en posicion.
25298     | we bought this when my daughter was one and she is four now‚Ä¶and still playing with it, even more so now then in her younger years. it is a great toy! i knocked a star off because we have the white and black typical cow print, and it gets filthy. the rubber just attracts and soaks up dirt and has since we got it, i am sitting here trying to scrub it and decided to write this review. it just looks filthy so easily, and has only ever been an indoor toy which is the only drawback for us.

25639     | this necklace looks like a piece of jewelry! it has a really nice color to it, and can be worn by either a boy or a girl. i really like that it‚Äôs all-natural, with no dyes or pharmaceuticals added ‚Äì kids could chew for hours and not ingest anything unsafe. the material and construction feels very high quality ‚Äì when you pull at the string, you'll feel that ths necklace won‚Äôt break, no matter how hard an overly eager baby may pull at it! this also means that the necklace presents less of a safety concern, since it seems impossible for the beads to be pulled apart and swallowed by accident. the beads themselves are genuine amber, and also feel very durable, and will withstand really strong, forceful bites. teething children will have a great time, and parents will feel confident that their children will be using a safe product. overall, this is a great alternative to other teething products out there. not only is this necklace all-natural, but it also has immune system-boosting properties and actually helps children feel better through the teething process. great product!
25765     | Works well enough for my purposes. Just the right size. I dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds (start) and minutes (number buttons). It's also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy. What brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves ‚Äì¬†super tiny, and the handle. While this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well, that doesn't make for a good combination for opening the door. So I have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door. I think this could be solved with some super rubber feet, but I shouldn't have to add them myself.
26218     | we, my daughter, grandson, and i love avent bottles and now theses cups.  we have tried others and they just don‚Äôt make our baby as happy as avent.<br /><br />he is mr. independent and really likes to take care of things without help if he can.  i told my daughter that she has a two-year old attitude in a one-year baby.  since he was about four or five months old he has wanted to eat or drink what we had to eat or drink.<br /><br />i have tried many different kinds of sippy cups, expensive to cheap, but nothing i tried worked until i found this one.  he wants what we have, but he is just not ready to give up the nipple.  he really likes drinking out of these.<br /><br />yes, he can hold a bottle, but with the handle these are different from a bottle and more like the cup that i have.  if we fill these with water, what i drink, or juice he really likes these.<br /><br />he will now drink with the spout, but there are times when he is tired that he still prefers the nipple.  we like that we have the option.  for our baby these saved many problems with a child that wants to be independent, but is not quite capable of doing it all by himself yet.
26538     | This microwave has more features than ANY other on the market...and aesthetically it is a work of art!  When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3¬Ω years and if we were lucky, we got 2¬Ω years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.  It ws determined that the unit was not repairable.  2/5/10 - 3rd party warranty company issued a check for the full purchase price of the unit.
26568     | Philips AVENT pacifier is designed with a lighter and smaller shield for newborns (0-2 months) and the collapsible nipples recognize the development of the baby‚Äôs palate, gums and teeth ‚Äì if any. The holes in the curved shield create more air flow to reduce skin irritation. And the pacifier comes with a snap on cap for good hygiene.<br /><br />The nipple is made strong so it won lose its shape after being used for a while. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized. Because it is the right size for newborns it will remain in the baby‚Äôs mouth, and not slip out or be spit out, making it more sanitary. The AVENT comes in a hand two-pack. Very nice product well designed and made with safe ingredients.

27110     | the first awesome thing about this toy is that it is machine washable, air dry only. i think it‚Äôs silly when kid‚Äôs toys are spot clean. you‚Äôre really not going to get a baby toy clean with spot cleaning, especially when the toy is meant to be a teether. the toy has a hanger and clacking beads, as well as different textures, including crinkle paper. so far, my son likes it, especially since it makes clattering noises when he bangs it against the floor.
27200     | I was at my wits end with my daughter. She was using me as a pacifier for her naps and not letting me get anything done. I kept trying to get her to take a pacifier but she would just spit them all out and cry. I tried the one from the hospital, MAMs, Nubi, even the cheap ones from the dollar store‚Ä¶nothing. Then I found these in one of my shopping bags (I didn't buy it nor did I even put it in my cart). She was only a little less than 2 months and I thought these might be too big for her mouth since it says 3+ months, but they weren't. She took to it immediately and loves them. Now I can actually lay her down for a nap without her waking up.<br />As a plus, the piece that sticks out in the back is squishy and I kind of like chewing on it while I feed her and my hands are full. However the whole for you to attach a clip or binky buddy is small so some won't fit.

28770     | CVM1790SSSS replaced our old Caf√© series microwave AT NO COST (within 5 years of purchase) as part of GE's &#34;Touchpad Replacement Program&#34;...(Kudos to GE for doing the right thing for that):<br /><br />Pro's:<br />-Touchpad completely redesigned (obviously less heat sensitive).<br />-Inside is stainless vs. enamel like the old one.  That is an obvious upgrade - for sure.<br />-The goofy tilt open top bar of the old unit is replaced with a fixed plate and top vents.<br />-Shortcut buttons are more useful for us vs. the old set-up.<br /><br />Con's (would have given a 5 Star except for):<br />-Control panel redesign includes a dial.  It is very easy to use, so only a con for being less attractive.<br />-Handle is plastic covered with metal looking coating vs. real metal like the old unit.  It seems very stout and the GE rep said the peeling was addressed this year, so we are hoping for the best.<br />-Emblem is now black vs. the original red like all the other pieces in the Caf√© set (easy fix - below).<br /><br />*We talked the installers into letting us keep the old emblem - The red emblem is held on by just 1 screw (easily removed).  The red emblem cap (metal) was easily separated from the mount plug with a knife and affixed on-top of the new/black emblem with some gentle adhesive...an easy fix and no damage to the black emblem or stainless fascia.

30291     | This diaper bag is eye-popping chipper and very trendy.  The first thing I noticed were snap-on nylon straps so I can attach this to a stroller.  The only thing I‚Äôll need to keep in mind is not to overload the Ecosusi.  That wouldn‚Äôt be very hard to do because there are so many pockets to tuck things in, including two little lined containers that match the bag.  I can use one for a bottle, the other for a pacifier.  It‚Äôs one of those diaper bags that was more than likely one in which they consulted mothers on.  It has all the features I like to see in a bag.<br /><br />There are synthetic zippers, which are easier to work, and metal zipper pulls.  The hardware is a mix of metal and plastic.  The one vulnerability I see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap. The material is waterproof 600d nylon, something I see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag.  The design is new-generation stylish, but with an old-fashioned dollop of fun I like.  It‚Äôs a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone.<br /><br />The inside of the bag‚Äôs design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets ... zippered elasticized, and simple.  I definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy.  There‚Äôs a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if you‚Äôre walking around.  The Ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers, a change of clothes, snacks, and other essentials needed for a small excursion.<br /><br />I do have stroller straps I can use to hook this diaper bag on my Graco for quick access.  As I mentioned, in does have those snap on nylon straps if you don‚Äôt have one.  It does have 1-1/2‚Äù nylon straps so I can swing it over my shoulder or, if I prefer, I can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles.  Diaper bags aren‚Äôt carried for long periods of time like backpacks and similar to my other one, the padding is lacking in the straps.  Rather par for the course in the diaper bag line unless you‚Äôre willing to buy something rather pricey.<br /><br />Pockets, pockets, pockets, changing pad, extra containers, metal zipper pulls, and on and on.  I do love this bag and I love the chipper design.  It‚Äôs quite roomy and has those little extras that make it quite appealing.

30477     | There are few things infants are more particular about than their binkies. Whether they‚Äôll take one at all and, if so, what kind they like. It‚Äôs a different answer for every baby.<br /><br />These Munchkin models are lightweight and look well-designed for newborns up to about three or four months of age. They‚Äôre small and specially designed to allow them to get a good, comforting suck going, without blocking their nose. They also don‚Äôt have a handle, because they‚Äôre designed for infants too young to grasp on their own. I‚Äôve found that if a parent puts their finger into the top of the nipple hole (from the opposite side), while the baby sucks, that can help encourage acceptance of a new paci in the very young. These are the perfect size for an adult pinky to slip into.<br /><br />They are listed as BPA-free on the packaging and can be washed in the dishwasher, which is very handy for sterilizing.<br /><br />As to whether YOUR newborn will love this particular style, it‚Äôs really hit or miss. With our (colicky) son we literally bought one of every pacifier from three different superstores and he wouldn‚Äôt take any of them. (Trust me, we would have given anything to find SOMETHING that soothed that kid.) Another child loved only the flat-ended types. (These Munchkin models have the longer, skinny nipples.) Some only like those green models most hospitals give out. Many infants also prefer a certain thickness or type of plastic and for the record, these are very squishy, thin silicone.<br /><br />As a mom, I‚Äôll note that if you find one your baby finds comforting, buy a bunch so you‚Äôll always have one handy.
30517     | I never thought it would be so useful to have a glowing pacifier, but believe me you will need it when your baby wakes up crying and you can¬¥t find your pacifier in the dark :)
30616     | i would pass on this gate. there are vastly better gates out there many of which cost less. this one for example i would highly recomend<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b006umub92/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=utf8&psc=1<br /><br />i bought this gate for the top of the stairs because the specs and reviews seemed to indicate it would work well for that. initially i was impressed with how it attached to the stairs as i will state in the pros<br /><br />pros<br />- the way it attaches to the stairs is actually among the best i have seen of any gate. most of my friends have to jury rig their gates with 2x4‚Äôs to get them to work on steps. this gate attaches to the banisters very easily and snugly.<br /><br />cons ‚Äì there are a lot<br />- i am unable to open this gate with one hand. i am 6‚Äô4‚Äù it is not because i am weak. you have to both unlatch the gate and lift it, but you cannot put enough force on the gate at the latch. you have to lift closer to the hinge.<br />- the instructions are hard to read and not very clear<br />- the screws it comes with are not nearly long enough, plan on needing your own.<br />- the way the gate latches does not work very well. you have to lift the gate up an inch, carefully position it over a hole, and then lower it in the hole. this seems easy, but it is not. it has a top and bottom hole to latch too and it is very difficult to get it to latch into both at the same time. other gates also are able to catch the gate when it is near the latch making latching them very easily. this gate does not have that.<br />- this one is very annoying. the gate extends to fit various size openings, but there is no way to lock it to a specific length. so basically every time you open the gate you end up changing the gate length and have to resize it again.<br /><br />in the end i had to duct tape the gate to keep it at one length, i broke off part of the latch to i could latch it with one hand, and i broke off the bottom latch. the gate is still strong and my daughter will not be able to open it, but it should just work.<br />this is also my 5th or 6th gate install so i know what i am doing.<br /><br />i only give this two stars because the banister attachments are quite good, just everything else is bad.
30831     | I‚Äôm always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling ‚Äì which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called ‚Äúoil-less‚Äù fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald‚Äôs, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I‚Äôd still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It‚Äôs part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll let you know when it will be done when we‚Äôre ready to let you know‚Äù feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

31321     | DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.  The goal is that the vegies fill the container and the container is covered with a lid---so that the steam is concentrated.  [[ASIN:B001HZY9CM Anchor Hocking 3 PieceCasserole Glass Bakeware Set with Bonus 2 Piece Kitchen Tool Set]]<br />&#62; If you don't have a glass casserole the right size, you can often use a glass or ceramic bowl, and use a saucer or small plate as a lid.<br />&#62; Heating plastic may cause it to de-gas toxic compounds---if you plan to heat left-overs in your microwave, it is best to use glass storage containers [[ASIN:B0000CFTB0 Pyrex 6022369 Storage 14-Piece Round Set, Clear with Blue Lids]].

31484     | I‚Äôm better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they‚Äôre both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that‚Äôs so that there aren‚Äôt large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair‚Äôs clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn‚Äôt give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for ‚Äúpixiecurling.‚Äù For those who don‚Äôt know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by ‚Äúpixiecurl‚Äù on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer‚Äôs diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn‚Äôt on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn‚Äôt being pushed away by airflow when you‚Äôre positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it‚Äôs a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that‚Äôs no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don‚Äôt use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I‚Äôm also unlikely to use hot, but it‚Äôs nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that‚Äôs really the shipping weight. It‚Äôs a little more than I‚Äôd like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don‚Äôt need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it‚Äôs still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother‚Äôs non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops‚Äôs instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

31653     | I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn‚Äôt work. Also it isn‚Äôt hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn‚Äôt realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.

31977     | I‚Äôm always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know ‚Ä¶ I know ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it ‚Ä¶ I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn‚Äôt say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon‚Äôs concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington‚Äôs fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say ‚Äúmay‚Äù because the difference wasn‚Äôt large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it‚Äôs the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I‚Äôve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That‚Äôs the whole point of going curly ‚Äì not having to do any hair drying. As for noise ‚Äì I can‚Äôt answer which one is quietest because I‚Äôm deaf. It‚Äôs not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn‚Äôt perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months.enever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That‚Äôs the whole point of going curly ‚Äì not having to do any hair drying.
