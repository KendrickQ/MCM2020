852     | These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take. They are molded symmetrically‚Äã so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down, it is still the same shape, and she is still happy.
1165     | My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I‚Äôm good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it.
1273     | With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.<br /><br />I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.<br /><br />According to the packaging, this product is known for being:<br /><br />POWERFUL ‚Äì Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini‚Äôs salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair<br />PRECISE ‚Äì The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting<br />ADJUSTABLE ‚Äì With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button<br />LIGHT WEIGHT ‚Äì Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users<br /><br />Overall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn‚Äôt get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.<br /><br />This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.
1368     | this is one of those products that change the way you live. we got this when our baby was 3.5 months old and she took to it immediately. she is now almost 7 months old. it is comfortable for both baby and her caregiver, whomever it may be at the time. my mil, husband, babysitter, and i are all different heights (153 cm to 172 cm) and different sizes (50 kg to 83 kg) and this carrier can adjust to fit us all comfortably. there are many things i love about this carrier.<br /><br />pros:<br />- the biggest pro for us is the mesh cooling vent. the daily temperature here averages 28¬∞c to 35¬∞c with tropical humidity. while you're never going to be completely cool while carrying baby, the mesh makes it much more comfortable to do so.<br />- did i mention how comfortable it is to use? the wide waist belt provides loads of support and the shoulder straps are thick & padded. i like that you can wear the waist strap higher (on the waist) or lower (resting on the hips) to adjust for baby's height. i love having my baby within kissing distance!<br />- comfortable for baby! she's snug as a bug in a rug and regularly falls asleep while still in the carrier. the inward-facing design doesn't seem to bother her as she can still see out the sides (outward-facing carriers are not good for baby's development). in fact, she seems to prefer being high up in the carrier as she has a better view rather than being in her stroller.<br />- the sleeping hood is generously cut and is large enough to accommodate even a tall toddler. the way the hood is designed means that there are no strings or straps that can cut into baby's face. the straps to fasten the hood are attached to it and it all rolls neatly into provided front pocket. there are no dangling strings or buckles to get in the way. we've used the hood to help her sleep, keep the sun off her face and to keep the rain off her head.<br />- the front pocket is not very large, especially with the hood already tucked into it. however there is enough space to tuck some keys, cash and a phone if all you're doing is going for a walk or a quick run to the store.<br />- easier and more convenient than a stroller. we no longer take our graco stroller on outings now. having to take a stroller was so cumbersome and unwieldy, especially in crowds. the stroller also took up all the space in the trunk. now we just put baby in her carrier, grab the ju ju be bff and we're ready to go.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the care instructions state that it is best to avoid washing the carrier and to spot clean only. this has something to do with the organic dye used on the fabric and is supposed to help keep the carrier looking new. this is not a huge issue for me but i can imagine it being a big deal for some others. i highly recommend buying the drool pads and using them with the carrier from the very beginning to avoid getting any stains on it.<br />- no way to attach anything to the carrier. i would have liked to have a d-ring or two on the carrier so that a toy / pacifier can be attached to it and within reach the moment it is needed. imo this is something small that would be a great improvement to the utility of the carrier.<br /><br />overall, a great product and well worth the money spent!
1439     | Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy too‚Ä¶and gets a 5 star rating!
1711     | I purchased the WubbaNub Giraffe for my 3 month old as a possible solution to his pacifier falling out as he‚Äôs falling asleep and him rooting around to find it and waking himself up. I saw the negative reviews and had concerns but all the positive reviews swayed me and I took a leap of faith to purchase.<br /><br />Well it arrived in super-fast time thanks to Amazon Prime, however the Giraffe and pacifier are so poor quality I‚Äôm returning immediately.<br /><br />The packaging arrived intact, though it looked a cheaply printed, I‚Äôve never seen these in stores but would love to compare packaging to check if this is authentic. The pacifier part is a joke. It‚Äôs tiny and not the standard AVENT soothie given to you at the hospital or that you can buy in stores. My main concern was that without opening the packaging, I could see that the giraffe body had holes in it and the stuffing was coming out. The stitching along the spine of the giraffe was very shoddy and loose and would fall apart within days, if not sooner.<br /><br />This item is potentially a serious choking hazard and SHOULD NOT be sold for babies or children. Amazon needs to stop selling these or at least verify quality/supplier. Maybe a few year's ago this was a good quality item but based on recent reviews on Amazon something has changed.

2570     | I‚Äôm always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling ‚Äì which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called ‚Äúoil-less‚Äù fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald‚Äôs, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I‚Äôd still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It‚Äôs part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll let you know when it will be done when we‚Äôre ready to let you know‚Äù feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)
