843     | I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn‚Äôt work. Also it isn‚Äôt hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn‚Äôt realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.
1197     | Nice little dryer‚Ä¶fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.
1485     | After reading several answers to my question about whether this dryer has 2 or 3 fan speeds, I decided to go ahead and buy it at a retail store.  I can tell you definitively that it has 3 heat settings, but only 2 fan settings.  The only difference between the medium and high settings is the temperature that blows out.  The fan speeds are actually low and medium.  It turns out that this worked out fine for me, because I wanted a dryer that didn‚Äôt feel like a hurricane while trying to style my short hair.<br /><br />People with long, thick hair probably won‚Äôt like this dryer because it doesn‚Äôt have a real powerful fan speed.  May I recommend for you guys the Conair 1875 Watt Ion Shine Hair Styler.  That dryer has 2 fan speeds, one is a gentle breeze, the other a virtual hurricane, but I bet it dries long hair in a jiffy.  I have relegated that dryer to the closet, perhaps to dry hand-washed clothes or something like that.

1653     | I‚Äôm always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know ‚Ä¶ I know ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it ‚Ä¶ I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn‚Äôt say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon‚Äôs concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington‚Äôs fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say ‚Äúmay‚Äù because the difference wasn‚Äôt large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it‚Äôs the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I‚Äôve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That‚Äôs the whole point of going curly ‚Äì not having to do any hair drying. As for noise ‚Äì I can‚Äôt answer which one is quietest because I‚Äôm deaf. It‚Äôs not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn‚Äôt perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months.enever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That‚Äôs the whole point of going curly ‚Äì not having to do any hair drying.

3876     | I rarely use a hair dryer to dry my hair but lately, I am tired of waiting for it to air dry.  When that happens, I use my handy dandy John Frieda Full Volume Hairy Dryer.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this product, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I actually received this product almost 2 years ago.  I use it when I want my hair dried quickly.<br /><br />The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer features frizz-fighting technology, 3 heat and two speed settings. I can add volume and shine to my hair with just a few minutes of use.<br /><br />My hair takes just a few minutes to dry. The hair dryer is very lightweight in my hands, so it doesn‚Äôt take a lot to blow dry my hair.  I use the cool setting most of the time since I don't like to use heat on my hair.  The cool setting comes in handy in the summer time.  Who wants to blow hot air on their hair in the dead of summer?<br /><br />The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer comes with 3 attachments, but I choose to use the dryer without any attachments. I just want to dry my hair, so I don‚Äôt bother with the attachments.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.
3961     | With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.<br /><br />I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.<br /><br />According to the packaging, this product is known for being:<br /><br />POWERFUL ‚Äì Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini‚Äôs salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair<br />PRECISE ‚Äì The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting<br />ADJUSTABLE ‚Äì With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button<br />LIGHT WEIGHT ‚Äì Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users<br /><br />Overall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn‚Äôt get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.<br /><br />This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.
4005     | I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn‚Äôt work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say ‚Äúultra-lightweight‚Äù). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn‚Äôt need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to ‚Äúset‚Äù the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn‚Äôt have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn‚Äôt out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She‚Äôs always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*
4138     | I used this dryer for the first time at a friend‚Äôs house.  It was amazing, it had the attachment on it and my hair was silky and dry within minutes.  I was so thrilled with it; I went online and bought one.  I still love it and the best part about the dryer is the warm setting.  You can dry your hair right at your scalp and not burn your head or heat up the bathroom to the point where you're sweating!!  I highly recommend this dryer.  I have had this dryer now for 6 months.
4211     | I've been using this dryer 3-4 times a week for about 3 months now.  The Infiniti is quieter, smaller (about 6&#34; high and 5 ¬æ&#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a champ.<br />  This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I'd be willing to toss my flat-iron.  I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.<br />  I'm a satisfied customer :)
4271     | I purchased this for traveling, and like that it has both diffuser and concentrator attachments.  I wish it had a cool setting but I can live without it for he price I paid‚Äîalthough I see it's come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value.  The storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered.  I checked out some mini hairdryers that cost up to 5 times as much‚Äîno way for something I may use 3 times in a year.<br /><br />I just wish t had a flat diffuser without the &#34;teeth&#34; ‚Äî I used to have that kind and prefer it.
4299     | really niceÔºÅ
4304     | So hot I couldn‚Äôt use it except to thaw ice in my freezer.
4492     | Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz
4862     | anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.<br /><br />*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn't quite follow .... üòâ<br /><br />So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.
4875     | This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)‚Ä¶so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But‚Ä¶I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

4889     | Best dryer ever.<br />I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I'm on my 2nd one of these in 3 years‚Ä¶ I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I've ever had.

5286     | For some time now I've been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and I have finally found it!! I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62¬∞F and the hottest is approximately 223¬∞F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!

6266     | The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! üòí
6677     | This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It‚Äôs powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.
6678     | The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn‚Äôt bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I‚Äôve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn‚Äôt completely soundless but it isn‚Äôt obnoxiously loud compared to others I‚Äôve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn‚Äôt as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.
6908     | Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I'm in love üòçüòçüòç
6910     | the quality of this dryer is outstanding! I will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons...A+üòâ
6916     | I am extremely happy that I purchased this hair dryer!  I have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30-35 minutes.  It does get pretty hot so I suggest a setting around 50 ‚Äì 55.  It‚Äôs very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow.  I do have to say, the first thing my husband said when he saw it was ‚Äúare you going to the moon?‚Äù ‚Äì as it does look like a space helmet.  The directions are not very clear but I managed to put it together just fine by myself and it‚Äôs very sturdy.  I definitely would recommend this dryer.
6979     | I‚Äôm better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they‚Äôre both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that‚Äôs so that there aren‚Äôt large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair‚Äôs clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn‚Äôt give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for ‚Äúpixiecurling.‚Äù For those who don‚Äôt know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by ‚Äúpixiecurl‚Äù on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer‚Äôs diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn‚Äôt on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn‚Äôt being pushed away by airflow when you‚Äôre positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it‚Äôs a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that‚Äôs no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don‚Äôt use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I‚Äôm also unlikely to use hot, but it‚Äôs nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that‚Äôs really the shipping weight. It‚Äôs a little more than I‚Äôd like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don‚Äôt need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it‚Äôs still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother‚Äôs non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops‚Äôs instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

7015     | I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways‚Ä¶ This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions‚Ä¶. but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice‚Ä¶. if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.
7197     | This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldn‚Äôt believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets.
7412     | As a bald man, I love this hair dryer. It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Ky≈çf≈´, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is f√∂hn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the &#34;lifeline shock protection&#34;. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary.

9650     | About Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ electric toothbrush by Arm & Hammer.  So I was trying to figure out how to change the battery/s for this toothbrush --- for a long time - lol too long! And I was feelin' a bit dumb (lol). I had  always had a problem with the switch with the  Arm & Hammer Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ. tooth brush - it was easy to turn on but it was actually a puzzle (not intuitive, to me anyway) to shut off. LOL - I knew the design of this T/Brush had out smarted me in the past so putting ego aside I went to the Web with my problem and to the Electric Tooth Brush Manufacture's site [...] by Arm & Hammer. I must say this is Very FLASH-e Web Site. (lol) Very typical, over the top - big company stuff! Designed for the Suit Client not the Toothbrush Customer. The web sit does not have a Site Search Field, I knew I was in for it right then!  YES there is a Q & A page but there is a lame Ask Us page that is really just a badly titled where to buy landing page., ([...]). It seems like you need to go two levels of pages in on this site to discover this page link found on the ASK US PAGE: [...] On the  FAQ page, How to change the battery for this model Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ was an unanswered question, others yes full and complete How To's, but not for this model! Curious? Which led me to Amazon to see what others knew about the Arm & (and) Hammer Spinbrush¬Æ Swirl¬Æ. I found my answer at Amazon. It seems instead of just saying that you have to toss this thing in the landfill where it will last for who know's how long the A&H approach is omission. Just not talking about the issue with their customers? It was almost like they were too embarrassed to put in writing the truth about such an un-ecofriendly electric tooth brush. Lessons I learned: I wasted a lot of time, I found the solution to my problem very quickly on Amazon, & I got what I paid for when I bought the cheapest Electric Toothbrush I could find. I am embarrassed to put this in the garbage but that's where it is.

9773     | If you have all the time in the world‚Ä¶buy this hair dryer. Agonizingly slow!
9910     | We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200¬∞ F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300¬∞ F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price. Once ours busts I will most likely purchase another Revlon.
9980     | A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! üòâ<br />THANKS AMAZON!

10183     | The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it will not stick to my vanity which is made out of wood. It won‚Äôt hold in place after I place the blow dryer. Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).
10711     | Hoy recib√≠ el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcion√≥. Es muy lamentable para m√≠ encontrarme con esta situaci√≥n. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. Gracias<br />Today I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you
10790     | I've had this dryer for 2 ¬Ω years. The latch that keeps the hood upright has finally warped and doesn't stand open. Otherwise, it heats nicely and evenly and the Ion feature leaves my hair shiny. It was so good that I refuse to buy another. I just rigged it with some flexi-rods to get the hood to stay open and upright. Yep, it's just that good.
10816     | it's great i enjoy working it. thanks much üòç
11013     | Just only use about one and half month, when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly. it's some part of inside the dryer was broken I guess and I really want to return this itemÔºÅI was very angry about the quality of this dryer!
11023     | Pros<br />‚Ä¢ lightweight (best feature)<br />‚Ä¢¬†strong force of air if you want it<br />‚Ä¢ multiple heat controls<br /><br />Cons<br />‚Ä¢ I don't think the diffuser does much, but I really don't care about that.
11056     | Works pretty well, but I've been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer‚Ä¶ which I didn't have to do before, but now if I don't, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.
11108     | I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. üòä
11388     | This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same. I recommend this hair dryer. Thanks Amazon. üòÄ
11422     | Everyone that comes over comments: ‚ÄúWHERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!‚Äù it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it‚Äôs easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it‚Äôs holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.<br />I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn‚Äôt have to drill holes. It‚Äôs holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it‚Äôs mount and work with it directly. Great buy
11454     | I waste my money on it! I have thin hair and this one doesn't work with me, not hot at all! üëé
