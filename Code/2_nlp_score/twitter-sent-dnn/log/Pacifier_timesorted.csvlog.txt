117     | i have had this highchair for a few months and wish i did more research before buying. the cover does not come off so you can't wash it and wiping it down is not enough. also, you need 2 hands to put the tray on. the tray usually doesn't allign right and takes some time to get it right. i thought the highchair came with a 5 point harness but does not. my baby slides and falls to the side while eating. this causes her discomfort since her arm gets all red from being pinned to the side or stuck hanging over the chair. wishing i bought another highchair üòï
176     | i ordered a set of the regular spill spoiler caps at the same time as i ordered a set of the sport caps.  i am equally pleased with both, so this review mirrors my comments on the sport caps.<br /><br />i drink nutritional drinks and energy drinks in the car and at home, and have a tendency to be a klutz and spill whatever i am drinking in the car and on the furniture.  when i happened onto the spill spoiler ad, i  ordered a set of the regular caps and a set of the sport caps.<br /><br />up-front, i will say i was very pleased to see a listing of the types and brands of bottles each cap fits.  i didn‚Äôt have to wonder if the cap would fit my particular drink bottle.<br /><br />upon receipt of the caps, i immediately tried them and found they do exactly what the ad says.  unscrew the drink‚Äôs regular cap, screw on the spill spoiler cap, stick in a straw, and you are ready to go.  pull out the straw and the hole closes and your drink doesn‚Äôt spill.  at the end of the day (or whenever), just put the cap into the dishwasher and it is ready to go again.<br /><br />i am elated to have found the spill spoiler.  since i am not only klutzy, but also have been known to lose things, i am going to order another one or two sets of each cap.  they work. i recommend them to anyone who drinks and spills things, and that is everyone.

398     | this is one of those products that change the way you live. we got this when our baby was 3.5 months old and she took to it immediately. she is now almost 7 months old. it is comfortable for both baby and her caregiver, whomever it may be at the time. my mil, husband, babysitter, and i are all different heights (153 cm to 172 cm) and different sizes (50 kg to 83 kg) and this carrier can adjust to fit us all comfortably. there are many things i love about this carrier.<br /><br />pros:<br />- the biggest pro for us is the mesh cooling vent. the daily temperature here averages 28¬∞c to 35¬∞c with tropical humidity. while you're never going to be completely cool while carrying baby, the mesh makes it much more comfortable to do so.<br />- did i mention how comfortable it is to use? the wide waist belt provides loads of support and the shoulder straps are thick & padded. i like that you can wear the waist strap higher (on the waist) or lower (resting on the hips) to adjust for baby's height. i love having my baby within kissing distance!<br />- comfortable for baby! she's snug as a bug in a rug and regularly falls asleep while still in the carrier. the inward-facing design doesn't seem to bother her as she can still see out the sides (outward-facing carriers are not good for baby's development). in fact, she seems to prefer being high up in the carrier as she has a better view rather than being in her stroller.<br />- the sleeping hood is generously cut and is large enough to accommodate even a tall toddler. the way the hood is designed means that there are no strings or straps that can cut into baby's face. the straps to fasten the hood are attached to it and it all rolls neatly into provided front pocket. there are no dangling strings or buckles to get in the way. we've used the hood to help her sleep, keep the sun off her face and to keep the rain off her head.<br />- the front pocket is not very large, especially with the hood already tucked into it. however there is enough space to tuck some keys, cash and a phone if all you're doing is going for a walk or a quick run to the store.<br />- easier and more convenient than a stroller. we no longer take our graco stroller on outings now. having to take a stroller was so cumbersome and unwieldy, especially in crowds. the stroller also took up all the space in the trunk. now we just put baby in her carrier, grab the ju ju be bff and we're ready to go.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the care instructions state that it is best to avoid washing the carrier and to spot clean only. this has something to do with the organic dye used on the fabric and is supposed to help keep the carrier looking new. this is not a huge issue for me but i can imagine it being a big deal for some others. i highly recommend buying the drool pads and using them with the carrier from the very beginning to avoid getting any stains on it.<br />- no way to attach anything to the carrier. i would have liked to have a d-ring or two on the carrier so that a toy / pacifier can be attached to it and within reach the moment it is needed. imo this is something small that would be a great improvement to the utility of the carrier.<br /><br />overall, a great product and well worth the money spent!

712     | Just received mine in the mail, and I am in love!!! This stroller is Super Sturdy, glides across the floor and seems to be super cushioned for baby. I love how large the basket is and there is tons of storage. I am totally, totally in love.  I just can't wait to use it when the baby comes. Everything I expected and more. Thanks RECAROüíï

802     | At about 15 days old, I gave in and tried a pacifier. It was a larger Nuk that someone gave as a gift‚Äîat the time I had no idea there were sizes for these things. After a day or two, our daughter seemed to &#34;latch&#34; with this and I got a nice long nap. Since it seemed to work well for her, I decided to come here to Amazon and order a few (and discovered the Newborn and other size options).<br /><br />Because I had her on a larger one previously, these &#34;Newborn&#34; pacifiers were immediately useless, as she would seemingly not even notice there was something to suck on and it would fall out of her mouth. The larger one we had gotten as a gift has a cover than closes when it falls, but my wife doesn't like that because she thinks it will leave a mark. I don't even know the size, so I am going to experiment and order some more now. Hopefully we'll get the right one.<br /><br />If you've used standard latex feeding nipples, these may not work for your baby at all because they are too small.

1292     | it's only $3‚Ä¶ but buy the munchkin one.  they last longer!
1386     | we loved the idea of this keepsake case for our baby book. thought it would be perfect to store the c.r. gibson baby book perfectly and keep it neat and tidy for years to come! we purchased the exact c.r. gibson baby book as pictured with the keepsake case in the stock photo. the keepsake case is way too small to accommodate the baby book, even when empty and not filled with memories, photos, ect. we did keep it, thinking it would be a nice place to keep photos, baby band from the hospital, well wishes, act from her early months‚Ä¶ but i would not recommend this product if wanting to use to keep that particular c.r. baby book inside.
1604     | this may be the worst baby monitor out there.  i initially received this one as a audience member at a talk show.  i thought score!  except when i go to plug it in, it never turns on.  it takes me a good 45minutes to figure out their website and how to contact someone to help me with the issue (every link would give me an error and not go through).  once i did reach someone - they were very good about emailing me and calling me, and agreed to send me a new one (under warranty), once i send them my monitor back.  so there i am‚Ä¶.monitor-less for a good month.<br /><br />i get the second one. it plugs in. it turns on.  except it keeps going out of service.  and it can't decide between nighttime or day time vision.  (and the nighttime isn't that great on this monitor - it's not very detailed‚Ä¶it's almost fuzzy.)  and then the entire unit just goes fuzzy and broken up.  so there i go again - contacting levana - and they send me a new one (a month later), once i send the unit back first (and that they receive it)<br /><br />i finally receive the third monitor.  and it works ok for 5 months or so. never perfect, but good enough.  one day it starts fuzzing again and blacking out.  this time, i have levana send me a unit before i send mine back.<br /><br />i received the new levana - and this one keeps going in and out of service - and this monitor is always in the same spot!<br /><br /> i finally gave up and purchased the motorola one.
1619     | my daughter won¬¥t eat the food that is suppose to be hot like soup or stews unless is hot, so half of the days she comes back with the thermos full. very disappointed.
1981     | excelente producto, exacto al que ofrecen, lo esperado, adaptado para el bebe, colores estupendos, tama√±o muy acorde, llegada muy rapida.
2048     | these bags are awesome. i keep them on the changing table and use them for soiled diapers. i used to use the diaper genie, but i hated leaving smelly diapers in the room until the container was filled. this way i just throw the diapers away as they are used.  i also keep them in my diaper bag. i've used them numerous times for wet or dirty clothesüòâ
2113     | Wonderful d√©cor for our granddaughter's room,, done in dragon flies and woodland animals.  we got a yellow and green one also arrived in a quick manner she loves it.
2432     | there is nothing better than looking back and seeing your little one safe and sound. rear facing is ideal for longer than most are aware. often times babies are turned around sooner than they should be because moms and dads are trying to keep an eye on them, or can‚Äôt see them, or their kiddo wants to see them. for their safety it‚Äôs best to keep them rear facing as long as possible and having a quality baby mirror makes that a bit easier to do.<br /><br />they made a mirror that has a clear view, and lets you see your precious baby in their safe rear facing car seat. the view is so clear that your baby will not have a difficult time seeing you as well.<br /><br />this baby mirror was super easy to install, and can be used with almost every vehicle as far as i can tell. the design provides for a large visible space, it is not heavy or bulky. i love affordable, quality baby items. if you don‚Äôt have a little one, you might consider buying one of these for someone you know who will be having a little one soon or has one! i think the design is actually really cute, and the soft rounded edges seem more appealing to me.<br /><br />**i received a free product for a review. my opinions are 100% honest and my own.**
2644     | love the glasses.  i purchased them for my 22 month old grandchild, and they are unbreakable, the first challenge they went through was being twisted around and they made it.  good price also.üòä

2931     | Avent is the brand I have used with my two kids, the third is on the way and I didn¬¥t doubt keeping working with Avent.
3037     | These are my favorite pacifiers. I especially love these for night because they glow in the dark and are easy to find when you‚Äôre trying to put a upset baby back to bed.

4438     | supportive and it prevents my daughter‚Äôs neck from moving back and forth while she‚Äôs sleeping. i love the fact it‚Äôs completely smooth one side and soft and furry on the other. my daughter prefers the smooth side; overall we are very pleased with this purchase.
4493     | we, my daughter, grandson, and i love avent bottles and now theses cups.  we have tried others and they just don‚Äôt make our baby as happy as avent.<br /><br />he is mr. independent and really likes to take care of things without help if he can.  i told my daughter that she has a two-year old attitude in a one-year baby.  since he was about four or five months old he has wanted to eat or drink what we had to eat or drink.<br /><br />i have tried many different kinds of sippy cups, expensive to cheap, but nothing i tried worked until i found this one.  he wants what we have, but he is just not ready to give up the nipple.  he really likes drinking out of these.<br /><br />yes, he can hold a bottle, but with the handle these are different from a bottle and more like the cup that i have.  if we fill these with water, what i drink, or juice he really likes these.<br /><br />he will now drink with the spout, but there are times when he is tired that he still prefers the nipple.  we like that we have the option.  for our baby these saved many problems with a child that wants to be independent, but is not quite capable of doing it all by himself yet.
4501     | this bag is very beautiful and doesn‚Äôt look like a diaper bag at all. the nylon material seems very durable and easy to clean. bottle  pockets on both sides of the bag  are insulated. i put on of the bottles for example  and you can see it on one of the pictures (i use playtex drop-in bottles).<br /><br />in front of the bag there are two pockets. the lower one can fit full size wallet and there still will be some space on the side. the top pocket could be perfect for cell phone or small items (i would use it for my personal things ), and to give you an idea how big it is on one of the pictures i put facial wipes mustela in it. once the wipes are in i am able to close the pocket but the top part of the wipe‚Äôs container sometimes gets on the way. also, zipper on this particular pocket is hard to work with. what i mean is that you will need to use two hand to close it. i think it because the placed zipper so high to the top of the bag.<br /><br />on the back of the bag there is a zipped compartment for changing pad. it‚Äôs a  standard size for skip hop brand  and i believe no bigger or smaller than most others.<br /><br />on the inside there are four pockets that are the same size. you might see from the picture that pockets are reinforced, which i love, because it hold things more secure. it doesn‚Äôt have bottle pockets on the inside of the bag. also, i like the color of the inside ‚Äì its not black so you can find things easier, but not too light to show dirt.  the stroller hooks can be placed on the inside of the bag  when not in use.<br /><br />my other favorite part is ‚Äì the bag has zipper on top! i don‚Äôt have to worry about everything flying out of the bag when i throw it in the car. the stroller hooks can be used even when the bag is closed, another big plus.<br /><br />the hardware is color of yellow gold, and as much as i dislike the yellow gold this particular tone doesn‚Äôt bother me.<br />the handles are very comfy.<br /><br />overall i would highly recommend  this bag to anybody who, like me, is looking for a diaper bag that doesn‚Äôt look like it. it is very roomy even if it doesn‚Äôt look like it. i was between this one and storksak .  skip hop holds same amount or even more and looks nicer.<br />but i do have my concerns: zippers would ne first one (i noticed when you place something in the front pocket it a little easier to close),  i wish the handles were from nylon material instead of faux leather ‚Äì would last longer, the same can be said about details ‚Äì i am not sure how long the faux leather will last, i also wish skip hop would add a shoulder strap (but it‚Äôs just personal preference)
4618     | There are few things infants are more particular about than their binkies. Whether they‚Äôll take one at all and, if so, what kind they like. It‚Äôs a different answer for every baby.<br /><br />These Munchkin models are lightweight and look well-designed for newborns up to about three or four months of age. They‚Äôre small and specially designed to allow them to get a good, comforting suck going, without blocking their nose. They also don‚Äôt have a handle, because they‚Äôre designed for infants too young to grasp on their own. I‚Äôve found that if a parent puts their finger into the top of the nipple hole (from the opposite side), while the baby sucks, that can help encourage acceptance of a new paci in the very young. These are the perfect size for an adult pinky to slip into.<br /><br />They are listed as BPA-free on the packaging and can be washed in the dishwasher, which is very handy for sterilizing.<br /><br />As to whether YOUR newborn will love this particular style, it‚Äôs really hit or miss. With our (colicky) son we literally bought one of every pacifier from three different superstores and he wouldn‚Äôt take any of them. (Trust me, we would have given anything to find SOMETHING that soothed that kid.) Another child loved only the flat-ended types. (These Munchkin models have the longer, skinny nipples.) Some only like those green models most hospitals give out. Many infants also prefer a certain thickness or type of plastic and for the record, these are very squishy, thin silicone.<br /><br />As a mom, I‚Äôll note that if you find one your baby finds comforting, buy a bunch so you‚Äôll always have one handy.
5403     | this bottle newborn feeding set is the best! my daughter loves all dr.brown¬¥s bottles! the bottle reduces the air intake in the child's mouth and prevents colic!
5737     | Great little pacifiers that are similar to the Soothies but supposed to stay closer to the babies face, so they slip out less. I can't say whether they actually do slip out less‚Ä¶ Seems about the same.The only thought I have is that they cut a little  Low on the babies lip so part of the lip is sticking over the pacifier. The feeling would annoying me, but I guess doesn't seem to bother the baby too much
5823     | i love these bottles! but never sterilize in a sterilizer that you don't know is safe or not safe for the bottles. mine warped. üòï
5899     | Just because he‚Äôs a baby don‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt have some attitude. He is half you, right? May as well be your darker half, haha. Also, the sounds people as they catch a glimpse are simply priceless
5945     | muy util para limpiar la nariz del bebe, lo unico es que hay que tener cuidado con el recipiente deposito de fluidos, el mismo es un poco delicado en el sistema de cerrado, se rompen las pesta√±as y queda impedido para mantener el deposito en posicion.
5983     | It¬¥s a great pacifier, my daughter like it. Howewer, if you want to buy it because it glows at night, just buy the regulars, the glow doesn't last more than 6 minutes.
5993     | brilla en la oscuridad cuando mas necesitas encontrarlo, tiene un tama√±o ideal y trae tapa, es perfecto para mi bebe.
6413     | She seems to pull this one out more than her other ones , I think because of how long it is. I'm not really sure , great product . She's just used to her pinky bear‚ò∫Ô∏è
6571     | My baby won't take any brand of pacifier. That being said, he loves to get put the toy in his mouth my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kitten is tiny (think beanie baby in a happy meal size). In their defense it did say kitten, not cat. Touch√©. If buy another one, I'm buying a giraffe.
6594     | Best baby product ever. The weight of the animal keeps the pacifier closer to my baby's mouth during sleep. She loves clutching the animal and holding it herself‚Äîa good item to help with basic motor skills.
6633     | We tried different styles and brands before and she didn¬¥t like them. But she likes this a lot. It works so she stops crying when there is nothing else to do.

6924     | Philips AVENT pacifier is designed with a lighter and smaller shield for newborns (0-2 months) and the collapsible nipples recognize the development of the baby‚Äôs palate, gums and teeth ‚Äì if any. The holes in the curved shield create more air flow to reduce skin irritation. And the pacifier comes with a snap on cap for good hygiene.<br /><br />The nipple is made strong so it won lose its shape after being used for a while. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized. Because it is the right size for newborns it will remain in the baby‚Äôs mouth, and not slip out or be spit out, making it more sanitary. The AVENT comes in a hand two-pack. Very nice product well designed and made with safe ingredients.
6925     | This was the perfect size for my friend‚Äôs Robyn‚Äôs baby.  She is going on three months old but was a tiny preemie.  Like a dog sniffing a bone, Baby Annaleigh played with it a while before suckling the passie.  The pacifier is contoured for great sucking support.<br /><br />The pack has two pacifier in it for $6 bucks which is a pretty good price, but I do not like the $9 in shipping.  I don‚Äôt know what BPA-free and is dishwasher safe.
6947     | My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I‚Äôm good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it.
7013     | This diaper bag is eye-popping chipper and very trendy.  The first thing I noticed were snap-on nylon straps so I can attach this to a stroller.  The only thing I‚Äôll need to keep in mind is not to overload the Ecosusi.  That wouldn‚Äôt be very hard to do because there are so many pockets to tuck things in, including two little lined containers that match the bag.  I can use one for a bottle, the other for a pacifier.  It‚Äôs one of those diaper bags that was more than likely one in which they consulted mothers on.  It has all the features I like to see in a bag.<br /><br />There are synthetic zippers, which are easier to work, and metal zipper pulls.  The hardware is a mix of metal and plastic.  The one vulnerability I see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap. The material is waterproof 600d nylon, something I see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag.  The design is new-generation stylish, but with an old-fashioned dollop of fun I like.  It‚Äôs a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone.<br /><br />The inside of the bag‚Äôs design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets ... zippered elasticized, and simple.  I definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy.  There‚Äôs a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if you‚Äôre walking around.  The Ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers, a change of clothes, snacks, and other essentials needed for a small excursion.<br /><br />I do have stroller straps I can use to hook this diaper bag on my Graco for quick access.  As I mentioned, in does have those snap on nylon straps if you don‚Äôt have one.  It does have 1-1/2‚Äù nylon straps so I can swing it over my shoulder or, if I prefer, I can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles.  Diaper bags aren‚Äôt carried for long periods of time like backpacks and similar to my other one, the padding is lacking in the straps.  Rather par for the course in the diaper bag line unless you‚Äôre willing to buy something rather pricey.<br /><br />Pockets, pockets, pockets, changing pad, extra containers, metal zipper pulls, and on and on.  I do love this bag and I love the chipper design.  It‚Äôs quite roomy and has those little extras that make it quite appealing.

Very nice, stylish, ultra-functional diaper bag that will come in handy.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.in the straps.

7016     | At first, I have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose. Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn‚Äôt have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn‚Äôt have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book. I love to read in the park.

7163     | My daughter only uses a binky to sleep or calm herself since birth (and now still at 6mos).  She was always dropping them and we had to put one back in her hand or mouth, constantly!  We tried straps too which helped us find the binky but was no use for her.  We also didn‚Äôt want to put her in the crib with anything with straps/clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.  We‚Äôve had both for 4 months and no visible wear and bodies are still solidly stitched.
7314     | I purchased the WubbaNub Giraffe for my 3 month old as a possible solution to his pacifier falling out as he‚Äôs falling asleep and him rooting around to find it and waking himself up. I saw the negative reviews and had concerns but all the positive reviews swayed me and I took a leap of faith to purchase.<br /><br />Well it arrived in super-fast time thanks to Amazon Prime, however the Giraffe and pacifier are so poor quality I‚Äôm returning immediately.<br /><br />The packaging arrived intact, though it looked a cheaply printed, I‚Äôve never seen these in stores but would love to compare packaging to check if this is authentic. The pacifier part is a joke. It‚Äôs tiny and not the standard AVENT soothie given to you at the hospital or that you can buy in stores. My main concern was that without opening the packaging, I could see that the giraffe body had holes in it and the stuffing was coming out. The stitching along the spine of the giraffe was very shoddy and loose and would fall apart within days, if not sooner.<br /><br />This item is potentially a serious choking hazard and SHOULD NOT be sold for babies or children. Amazon needs to stop selling these or at least verify quality/supplier. Maybe a few year's ago this was a good quality item but based on recent reviews on Amazon something has changed.
7348     | I absolutely love it for my son! He loves it as well. The nipple is perfect just like the one given at the hospital, easy too clean! Bought two one to go out and one for home! üëçüòÅ
7400     | These funny little pacifier/animal combos have been a lifesaver! They generally stay in baby‚Äôs mouth a little longer than a standard pacifier and give her something to hold on to. The attached pacifier is a Soothie, which is the only type of pacifier our daughter would take. I also got a few extra Soothies to stick in the diaper bag for emergencies. Not to mention these Wubbanubs look adorable! Our favorite is the giraffe. (If you ever happen to run into him, ours is named Carl). This was featured on my Top 10 Items for Baby list!

7580     | the zipper broke on this cover the first time i was putting it on‚Ä¶even before the baby was born. the fabric was thin and poor quality too. i like the design but the cover doesn't help me out with a broken zipper! poorly made.
7829     | linda cartera de hannah montana para las ni√±as, llego a buen tiempo y a buen precio a mi sobrina le va a entantar como regalo de navidad
8007     | some of the toys are ok, one broke when i cleaned it so my daughter never got to use it and another broke into pieces 5 min after i handed it to her, she is only 5 months, so she didn't need a lot of power to brake it.<br />but what can you expect when you buy 6 toys for 6$? üòù
8097     | love it‚Ä¶.

8571     | PACIFIER ITSELF IS TOO HARD. THE STUFFED ANIMAL THOUGH IS CUTE. MY NEWBORN NEVER LIKED IT. MAYBE HER MOUTH WAS TOO SMALL IDK....but its ¬™ great teether tho.. Soothed her gums while she was cutting teeth
8650     | It¬¥s ok for a new born but for my 5 months old its too soft. I bought it for him to sleep at night and hold on to something (he love to have something for comforting) but this item never work. My recommend is to buy it for 0-3 mos.
8663     | My baby would not take a pacifier (from birth to now, 6 months) yet had a very strong suck/chew desire.  A friend (pediatrician) gave us one of these as a shower gift.  My son LOVES it.  He chews/sucks on it from all angles and it sooths him like nothing else. The pacifier is very well attached, I inspect it daily and it is not loosening or wearing at all.  We ordered this second one so we would have a spare.<br />Highly recommend! Buy it! It‚Äôs the best 15 bucks we have spent.
8757     | cute idea!  Mommy & Daddy-to-be were impressed with it and goes well the theme & d√©cor of baby's room! Fast delivery and in good shape-was here in plenty of time for shower!

9046     | Let me say first, shipping and such was amazing. I ordered these on a Friday night and received them on a Sunday! I don't know if anyone else ever received mail on a Sunday from the USPS but it was a first for me and it was amazing to get it so quickly. Now the product; exactly what I expected to receive. I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are üòä) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.
9118     | So disappointed with a recent order of these pacifiers. My newest baby had been using one from two years ago (2012) that my older child never used. We love the old one‚Äîsturdy, thick, quality rubber, darker amber color, matte look/feel, perfectly molded. Though after 3 months of consistent use it has started to wear down/disintegrate. But this new 2-pack I just received is nothing like the ones from two years ago. They're cheap feeling, flimsy, thinner, shiny, the edges are ragged with extra rubber pieces. I'm so let down because we've loved our old Natursutten SO much! The old one is so rich looking. The new style is no better than the cheap ones from the grocery store. Sad.
9152     | not real itemÔºåshipping is too slow
9262     | we bought this when my daughter was one and she is four now‚Ä¶and still playing with it, even more so now then in her younger years. it is a great toy! i knocked a star off because we have the white and black typical cow print, and it gets filthy. the rubber just attracts and soaks up dirt and has since we got it, i am sitting here trying to scrub it and decided to write this review. it just looks filthy so easily, and has only ever been an indoor toy which is the only drawback for us.
9317     | amazing natural product !<br />i used it on my baby for 2 months and its fabulous !  he has smooth skin & rash is gone..<br />it also moisturises extremelty well ! my baby loves it !!<br />thank you &#34;la petite cr√®me&#34;<br />happy baby , happy mommy ! üòä

10185     | My newborn girl loves this pacifier.¬† The first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home, since the one they give are the standart blue with MAM written on it, I wanted something cute for my girl, so I bought from another brand that looked way nicer, but my baby wouldn't take it, so I checked online and found these and I love that they're exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute.
10256     | This gave us a modest amount of fun, but I won‚Äôt trip on my feet for it.
10653     | Great product!üëç this product will save you lots of money. You will be able to keep up with pacifiers . I highly recommend.

10960     | i bought one of these and tested today for the first time.<br /><br />i became very happy with the smart two way communication of this device. beyond the fact of the product allow the parents to talk to the baby over voice, it turns off the infrared lights of the camera when you are not viewing the baby!<br /><br />normally i don¬¥t like motorola products, but this is over my spectations!<br /><br />thank you amazon.com!

11423     | These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take. They are molded symmetrically‚Äã so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down, it is still the same shape, and she is still happy.
11461     | i am pretty thrilled with this bike trailer. i use it more as a jogger, but my man and i have both taken our 20-month-old around in it as a trailer, and we all love it.<br /><br />best points:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ assembly and breaking down for storage is a snap. button-release tires and simple-yet-sophisticated folding make it quick to deal with. (keep in mind, though, that it's designed around utility, so it's going to take a little longer than your average street stroller. the first time, as with most new gadgets, takes a bit longer, too.)<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the cabin is very spacious, and will handily accommodate our child's long torso as he grows.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ storage 'trunk' behind the seating and pockets in the cabin hold plenty. there's lots of foot room, so i often put things at my son's feet, too.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the rigid floor is excellent. it supports his feet and keeps his legs more comfortable than the soft-floored ones can.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the feature that i love most isn't mentioned in the manual at all, i assume for legal reasons. there are leg holes under the handle that render it into a shopping-cart-style seat, so when we're out for a long time, and my son has had enough of looking forward on his own, he can join me as i push it along. this feature alone is priceless. it has saved the day countless times already in the few months we've had it. there is no harness, so i am very careful, and i would never take my hands off it when he's there, but it is well designed. it seems insubstantial, but holds him very well. (it helps to have some cargo in the front, for balance.)<br /><br />‚Ä¢ it is undeniably handsome. i probably wouldn't have chosen the bright yellow if there had been more options, but it is cheerful and easy to look at. it is also easy to see, which makes it safer.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ it is vented. most of the time, we keep the bug screen and window open and stowed, so ventilation isn't much of an issue, but in rain or cooler weather, the vent underthe handle is terrific. to keep airflow going, i zip the window down on both sides, but tuck the bottom inch or two up next to the screen.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ soft seat means with two riders, they'll squish toward the middle. it's easy to fix by adding something rigid underneath. when his buddy comes along, that's what we do, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ the back of a bike helmet pushes the child's head forward, which must be uncomfortable. i got no complaint from my little guy, but i'm thinking of a way to fix it, because it bugs me.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ while i wouldn't call it heavy, i've seen other bike trailers out there that are tiny and look featherlight. anyone who spends much time on a bike knows how much weight matters. it's easy enough to haul around, but its features and size mean that it's no fun coming across  a stop sign when you're starting up a hill with two kids in the trailer.<br /><br />all in all, this is a superb piece of equipment.
11462     | i love these packets! they are so easy to use and i love that i can throw them in the dishwasher and the freezer. they make baby-food pur√©e storing a breeze! i want to buy more!!
11570     | just used this on my graco lightrider stroller. totally did the job. it doesn't &#34;fit&#34; or anything, looks pretty clumsy overall, but when you've got rain and you're in a city and you've got to take the dog out, etc‚Ä¶ it works.
11686     | If there were more stars to give I would!  The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are √ºber nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting/baby shower/new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...

12077     | Soo in LuV with these..we just received the blue Okey dokey dino and the red dragon..we also have the monkey and giraffe. They are perfect for comforting, and binky doesn't get lostüòä<br />Oh and free shipping was super fast..ordered on the 18th,  received on the 21st. We were supposed to get them between 24- 27,28.
12465     | we bought this car seat for my husband¬¥s car (we only had one in my car).  the one i have is the britax blvd and this graco comfortsport is comfortable, and very secure (check the consumer report ratings, very high security wise).  the only bad thing was the head support, we ended up removing it and my toddler doesn¬¥t need it anymore...it still is not a big deal  overall highly recommended for its safety reviews, comfort and price!  great purchase!
12469     | these pouches are surprisingly easy to clean. the seal is tight and my toddler has yet discovered how to open them - i doubt he could if he tried. this is a great, mess-free way to get little babies/toddlers to eat food that you otherwise wouldn't let them eat on their own without making a mess (i.e yogurt, applesauce, pur√©es). my son takes it to preschool and it always comes back empty. love it!

12744     | we love this backseat organizer made from logiclux. it has a neat and simple design that makes it easy to install and use as well. it has plastic hooks at the end of the long straps attached on the top & bottom of the organizer that helps to secure the backseat organizer. it has deeper and different sizes of pockets to accommodate more objects in the car. it is crafted from quality materials, which assures that various pockets and tightly stitched straps won‚Äôt tear by the stress brought on by the array of objects. since it is detachable, it can be removed when not needed.the backseat car organizer‚Äôs solid pockets are not only ideal for arranging kids items but it is also perfect for holding sanitizers, coupons, calculators, notepads etc., i‚Äôm very much satisfied with this logiclux backseat car organizer. it's really great for the busy mom on the go or anyone trying to keep their car more organized and have the items you need readily accessible. i love this product and would definitely recommend to others.i am glad to be a part of the promo to test and provide my unbiased reviews
12804     | I was at my wits end with my daughter. She was using me as a pacifier for her naps and not letting me get anything done. I kept trying to get her to take a pacifier but she would just spit them all out and cry. I tried the one from the hospital, MAMs, Nubi, even the cheap ones from the dollar store‚Ä¶nothing. Then I found these in one of my shopping bags (I didn't buy it nor did I even put it in my cart). She was only a little less than 2 months and I thought these might be too big for her mouth since it says 3+ months, but they weren't. She took to it immediately and loves them. Now I can actually lay her down for a nap without her waking up.<br />As a plus, the piece that sticks out in the back is squishy and I kind of like chewing on it while I feed her and my hands are full. However the whole for you to attach a clip or binky buddy is small so some won't fit.
13213     | it‚Äòs good!
13222     | cute pattern, but this is not 100 percent cotton, as advertised. it‚Äôs not that big a deal, so we use it, but i really was looking for 100 percent cotton.
13257     | i always eyed this rattle in the baby toy aisle, but was skeptical it was worth $4. found it for 50¬¢ and decided to get it, and i wish i had never hesitated! my 3.5 month old grips the cross-style body easily and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys. the mirror side makes the balls seem to glow and always catches eye. this and his take along tunes have been his diaper-bag-must-haves.
13372     | With the glow in the dark pacifiers my daughter can now find her pacifier in the dark and put it back in her mouth so I don‚Äôt have to get out of bed an help. It‚Äôs wonderful!!!
13555     | I absolutely adore this company‚Ä¶.. Two of my cousins just had babies and I bought them both this product‚Ä¶. They loved them. Nicely done‚Ä¶.perfect shower gift.

13654     | I‚Äòm going to have baby this September. i want to take some picture of him when he using this thing. Just not sure it's safety enough.
13976     | just used the go glass bottle for the first time and love it!! more importantly my one month old loves it! super cute as well üòÑ easy to clean definitely recommend üëçüèª
14179     | I thought i was going to recieve these adorable paci's that was shown one having a car and the other having a plane on it i was so excited!! Until i opend them....one had a motorcycle and the other a lions faceüòî i never seen that option listed...
14191     | this is not a body pillow‚Ä¶.i highly recommend the full size leachco.  this was not very useful to me as it didn't offer me the support or comfort that the full size pillow does----which is all around comfort.  this one may be convenient for naps on the sofa but def not for a long slumber.  the pattern is much nicer on the mini than the large.
14203     | these sheets are pretty awesome! the bottom sheet is fitted, which is expected. but then, the top sheet has fitted pockets on both corners; so you don't have to do hospital corners! that is absolutely a huge deal when you're dealing with a toddler bed that has rails or bars on two of the three sides down at the foot. the pockets keep the top sheet right in place!!! i want that in my california king sheets!!!! now to the drawbacks: they wrinkle seriously. the material is not soft. i was disappointed that the top sheet is reversed. they are a little too high priced. i don‚Äôt know how well they will hold up after multiple washing ‚Äì but i‚Äôm hoping they are as awesome as the fitted pockets!!
14284     | This was the only paci one of my kids would take. Just had another little one a few days ago and he has already taken to this with zero issuesüòä
14356     | my granddaughter even she is 9 yr old still love dinosairs and its really hard to find d√©cor for this age group and specialy for girls .this product really brought nice &#34;dino&#34; touch. lol she is happy and so do i.
14381     | great addition to our bedding set!  love how it ties neatly at the end of the crib for easy access.  out of the way, but still a nice accent to add to the room's d√©cor.
14622     | I haven't tried these out on my baby yet (due to him not being born yet); however, the pacifiers that I received do not look like the ones shown. They're a solid color rather than the striped - which I had really liked and anticipated. I ordered these for my fianc√©'s birthday, which is coming up, otherwise I'd return them. They're not horrible, just not what I had expected.
14931     | Keeping for unborn baby. Both of them seems niceÔºÅ
14982     | what i like most about these thermos containers is that the liquid will stay cold for a long time. i haven‚Äôt tested exactly how long. but i live in southern california and it can get very hot here. i will put water with ice in these and leave the house with the kids around 9 am and the water is still cold when we eat lunch around 1 pm. while i do not use this for milk or juice, i can see that these would work well to carry milk out of the house for later.<br /><br />they are easy to clean and i like they are not made of plastic. i believe the straw parts are silicone ‚Äì this is great if your kids tend to chew on the straw like mine do. these are very durable. it is a little hard to take apart sometimes for cleaning, but once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs fine. this is dishwasher safe, although the cap would likely melt if it falls into the heating unit of your dishwasher.<br /><br />the top has three parts: the plastic lid, the straw that goes in your mouth and the long tube to reach for the liquid. my husband tends to forget to add the straw ‚Äì and without it you cannot drink! this cup is very durable. it will leak if your child shakes it, holds it upside down and sometimes it may splash a drop when popped open. but because i use this for water it isn't a problem as it has not proved to be at all messy. but i would not recommend for younger toddlers that shake their cups. these [[asin:b00ohkrm5a playtex playtime straw sippy cup, super friends, 9 ounce]] worked really well when my kids were younger.
15450     | have bought countless of these (eaten by family dog). lifesavers‚Ä¶. my #1 item to make sure that i have before leaving the house!
15457     | Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy too‚Ä¶and gets a 5 star rating!
15595     | i love them üòçüòçüòç
15657     | very niceÔºÅ
15674     | repaired for my babyÔºÅ
15700     | the first awesome thing about this toy is that it is machine washable, air dry only. i think it‚Äôs silly when kid‚Äôs toys are spot clean. you‚Äôre really not going to get a baby toy clean with spot cleaning, especially when the toy is meant to be a teether. the toy has a hanger and clacking beads, as well as different textures, including crinkle paper. so far, my son likes it, especially since it makes clattering noises when he bangs it against the floor.
15750     | this necklace looks like a piece of jewelry! it has a really nice color to it, and can be worn by either a boy or a girl. i really like that it‚Äôs all-natural, with no dyes or pharmaceuticals added ‚Äì kids could chew for hours and not ingest anything unsafe. the material and construction feels very high quality ‚Äì when you pull at the string, you'll feel that ths necklace won‚Äôt break, no matter how hard an overly eager baby may pull at it! this also means that the necklace presents less of a safety concern, since it seems impossible for the beads to be pulled apart and swallowed by accident. the beads themselves are genuine amber, and also feel very durable, and will withstand really strong, forceful bites. teething children will have a great time, and parents will feel confident that their children will be using a safe product. overall, this is a great alternative to other teething products out there. not only is this necklace all-natural, but it also has immune system-boosting properties and actually helps children feel better through the teething process. great product!

16897     | love all the britax brand car seats‚Ä¶.easy to use, dependable, durable. my son is two and been a beating, but when he's older, we will buy the britax booster, and when the new baby is due, we will buy another infant car seat from britax. we drive in a busy seat breaking hard, swerving and he just sleeps!

17594     | i would pass on this gate. there are vastly better gates out there many of which cost less. this one for example i would highly recomend<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b006umub92/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=utf8&psc=1<br /><br />i bought this gate for the top of the stairs because the specs and reviews seemed to indicate it would work well for that. initially i was impressed with how it attached to the stairs as i will state in the pros<br /><br />pros<br />- the way it attaches to the stairs is actually among the best i have seen of any gate. most of my friends have to jury rig their gates with 2x4‚Äôs to get them to work on steps. this gate attaches to the banisters very easily and snugly.<br /><br />cons ‚Äì there are a lot<br />- i am unable to open this gate with one hand. i am 6‚Äô4‚Äù it is not because i am weak. you have to both unlatch the gate and lift it, but you cannot put enough force on the gate at the latch. you have to lift closer to the hinge.<br />- the instructions are hard to read and not very clear<br />- the screws it comes with are not nearly long enough, plan on needing your own.<br />- the way the gate latches does not work very well. you have to lift the gate up an inch, carefully position it over a hole, and then lower it in the hole. this seems easy, but it is not. it has a top and bottom hole to latch too and it is very difficult to get it to latch into both at the same time. other gates also are able to catch the gate when it is near the latch making latching them very easily. this gate does not have that.<br />- this one is very annoying. the gate extends to fit various size openings, but there is no way to lock it to a specific length. so basically every time you open the gate you end up changing the gate length and have to resize it again.<br /><br />in the end i had to duct tape the gate to keep it at one length, i broke off part of the latch to i could latch it with one hand, and i broke off the bottom latch. the gate is still strong and my daughter will not be able to open it, but it should just work.<br />this is also my 5th or 6th gate install so i know what i am doing.<br /><br />i only give this two stars because the banister attachments are quite good, just everything else is bad.

I don't understand why they make it so water can get inside.<br /><br />Luckily my baby spits it out at around 9 months so we won‚Äôt have to.  When you see 2 year olds sucking on this, it's only the tip of the iceberg and the problem is near by.  I saw it once and couldn‚Äôt get the horrible image out of my head for months.  Reminded me of Chucky.

18110     | The item is great. Strudy and all. Perfect size for two pacifiers and a convenient loop to attach it to the stroller. My only concern is... PINK? From all the colors I could have received I got PINK! For a boy! No way. I¬¥m using it anyway but keeping it inside the diaper bag. Pink! :P
18188     | love the mat!  so happy about the purchase.  rolls up, very light and travels easily.  we take it to other people's houses and on vacations (haven't taken it on the plane yet).  awesome on vacation because you don't want your baby crawling and playing around on gross hotel room carpet.  perfect size.  cover washes great and easy to get on.  it also is a great neutral color that works well with the d√©cor of most rooms.  it works great on rugs, tile and wood floors.  i've never seen it slip on tile.<br /><br />note - i saw some reviews saying that the cover was hard to get back on once it had been washed but i completely disagree.  super easy and i'm usually terrible with stuff like that.  i wash it once a week and i've never had a problem.<br /><br />recommendations to manufacturer: (1) sell replacement covers so i can use the mat while the i'm washing the cover, (2) maybe offer a bigger mat option if people want to fill up an entire room.  a more permanent mat solution.<br /><br />the only con is the price.  very expensive for a play mat but worth it.  organic, high quality and made in the usa.  would purchase a dozen more if i could!!
