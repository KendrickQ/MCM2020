Love it!,"This arrived in the mail yesterday - My daughter is due in 5 weeks and I've read so many great reviews on these little things that I just had to buy one for her. When it came I was surprised at how SMALL it really is!<br /><br />When you look at photos of other people's photos of their babies holding these they look pretty decent in size, like this would be something that baby could use as a stuffed animal in a year or so, once they are off a pacifier. We ordered the lamb one, and with the pacifier off of it (It'll just take a few scissor snips to take it off), it looks like it could be a toy for a dog!<br /><br />It's so darn cute and tiny though... My 8lb poodle saw it come out of the bag an immediately sat in front of me, thinking it was a new toy for her. We've put it in the nursery and now she sits at the door waiting to go in so she can try and find it. (haha!) I will update this after baby arrives and we have a chance to use it, but I am hopeful that it will be a big success!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/14/12<br /><br />My daughter is 7 weeks now and she loves this thing. We recently took it on a trip to CA, and I make sure it's always in her diaper bag when we leave the house. We also have the blue bear one of these that stays at home as well. It's been great to keep it in her mouth when sleeping (she's a tummy sleeper), and when in the baby carrier, I don't have to worry about her dropping it and losing it in the carrier!<br /><br />Also - Our cousin has about 9 of these ones for his son, and they love them as well!",2012-06-28,1.0,pacifier,0.9994966775579688,0.9987729718601629

Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple.

The pacifier was fantastic obviously but what I really loved about the wubbanub frog was that even after he weaned himself at five months he still liked to carry around and cuddle the frog. When I worked in pediatrics we were given a bunch for free in an attempt to get the hospital to sign on to purchasing them, sadly they did not but during that time I was sold.

I bought my son the pink bunny for his Easter basket and I'm going to have to really check it over before giving it to him. He was so sad when his purple one &#34;got hurt&#34; and I'm pretty mad he was distressed by something so avoidable.<br /><br />*SECOND UPDATE*<br />As I mentioned above we bought this in both pink and purple. While the pink seemed solid at first the stitching on her nose started to unravel as well. We own close to 30 of these and these two are only ones to have issues like this (we had a penguin that came with a ripped pacifier but that's a different issue). Clearly the quality of this particular style is lacking. To have both come apart in the exact same way is really disappointing. I've fixed both noses myself but I should never have had to do that. For this reason I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.",2014-02-21,0.8,pacifier,0.08426551621210389,0.9424546854301229

I wanted my LO to use the Nattursutten pacifier because it's made of all natural rubber and is one piece (no space or hole for bacterial growth) but even though I purchased the butterfly shape, it was so big that it covered my LO's nose. And my LO is quite large for his age so it wasn't because of his size.  Other moms complain about the same design flaw, too.<br /><br />My second choice was the Gumdrop pacifier because although it isn't made of the same high quality material as the Nattursutten, it was one piece so again, no holes for bacteria to grow in.  But the pacifier was so heavy that my LO couldn't keep it in his mouth and I didn't want my LO to have to use so much force when using a binky.  Just logically speaking, I would think the LO's jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long.<br /><br />So then I tried Advent and Dr. Brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils.<br /><br />I ended up using MAMS pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn't obstruct my LO's breathing at all.  But they are a pain to clean- the part that the LO sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there.  After awhile, it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing.<br /><br />As soon as my LO was older, I again tried the Nattersutten.  Still same problem- covered his entire nose.  Back to Gumdrop and thank goodness, this time, my LO was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% satisfied with it because I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow (makes cleaning a pain).  Oh and the design makes LO look like Hannibal Lecter.  It's a bit disturbing to me.  Haha. But for now, my concern about bacteria growth in the MAMS binkies outweighs these issues.<br /><br />Until Nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area, I recommend the Gumdrop version.",2014-12-27,0.0,pacifier,0.8946291644410436,0.113962871811026

I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!",2015-02-11,0.0,hair_dryer,0.9872818700921056,0.5617917353248713

We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.  We ended up getting a MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] and he loves it.

My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic Pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top/bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    Pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie.",2009-08-10,1.0,pacifier,0.7799334505538934,0.5497201876609573

Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.

First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.

I use hot rollers and my hair is thin so I have to be careful with products left on hair weighing it down.  Even with the regular hair spray my hair would look like helmot head..and would fall before I even went outside.  Outside, in the sun, would cake.    Anyway I read that the Sebastian products were amazing. So with high hopes I purcahsed the re-shaper with the mindset you could finger thorugh, etc.    I even went as far as spraying each section before I hot rolled it for the layered in hold.  Then spritzed all over when done.  Today, after I did this I had amazing curls, etc..  Didnt even leave the house just went into the other room which is my office.  IT is air conditioned so have not been outside yet.  The door bell rang less than 20minutes and I passed by the mirror and the hair has completely FALLEN!  This is after I layered every curl and sprayed entire head with re-shaper as a finisher.    What a disappointment.  My hair is sticky too.  Im not sure why the other poster said it stayed great even after finger combing.  Maybe because it was just a few hairs on her head (bangs).    My hair has fallen and left with the feeling of hair spray on my hair.      So, not sure what the hype was all about. I have never used hair spray so much and it did nothing.      Lastly, my fingers did snag quite considerably when I tried to comb my hair with my fingers behind my ear. Since the curls fell, I tried to put my hair behind my ears so it wouldnt be in my face and my fingers got caught in all the sticky mess.

It's already been getting a lot of use, and is holding up great so far. Of course, I know it hasn't been used that long, so I'll be sure to update my review as they use it more.<br /><br />The nicest features of this are:<br /><br />* It's a microwave that also grills and crisps food -- so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave.  It comes with a grill rack, and you can cook meat on it.  When you use the grill function, you can put metal into the microwave . . . but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper. The gill function works fine, but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does.<br /><br />*  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas, and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked.<br /><br />* The 1,000 watts make this pretty powerful.  It's good at evenly cooking food, and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do.<br /><br />*  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button, so you can easily add more time to your cooking time.<br /><br />* A standard variety of pre-set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn, veggies, and potatoes.<br /><br />* The exterior has a scratch-resistant coating, and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does.<br /><br />The measurements on the 1.1 cubic foot microwave are: 11-11/16 H by 20-3/8 W by 15-13/16 D in inches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really nice microwave.

This pacifier is amazing.  When my son was a small infant his pacifier would constantly fall out meaning he would wake up and want it back, but being a infant he could not find it.  However with this product, if the pacifier fell out of his mouth it would still be lying on him and he would be able to find it again to sooth him back to sleep.  Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.  Now that he is just over one, it is his lovey, he likes to have it with him when he is ready for a nap or needs comfort.  When he is too old for the pacifier part, I plan to just snip off the pacifier and he will have his little friend he will have a much easier time letting go.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention it is adorable!",2012-09-03,0.0,pacifier,0.0794778765472197,0.00024884989944746273

One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.

The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

Looks expensive.","This is a very nice, professional looking hairdryer. Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's &#34;ultra lightweight&#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.

(not recommended).  i am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather i think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  since then, obviously we figured it out. and now we love this carseat.<br /><br />i own both the boulevard cs 70 and the marathon versions of the britax seats.  the boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the marathon. i like that the seatbelt clicks. at first, i hated it because i felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. but now i feel like i need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  the marathon that i have does not have the click feature, and i never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />we decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and i am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  a few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) newborns need a full recline! otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  we had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) when the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  my husband is 6'4&#34;.  this is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  we actually bought a new car all because of this!!! not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) the cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) i highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  that was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) if you are in a bumpy ride (think a jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) it takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  you have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. it's annoying but possible.<br /><br />overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!",2013-11-07,0.6666666666666666,pacifier,0.03677482597334247,0.37885006422498524

Because of this, the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep.  This is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self-soothe at night time.  As I mentioned earlier, the shape and texture are different - very similar to a thumb.  Since this is so similar to the thumb, your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb.

I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future.",2014-06-30,0.5,hair_dryer,0.25935386102555424,0.008200827943731177

I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.",2014-02-25,1.0,hair_dryer,0.9999729842680852,0.9774060898039383

You put your baby's pacifier in the compartment, close the lid and the UV light comes on. It turns off after about 3 minutes and it claims that the pacifier is clean. I'd stick with inserting this in your Avent steam or electric sterilizer or boiling it in a pan of water.

Same pacifier given to babies in the hospital!","My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-08-30,0.0,pacifier,0.01172623673169828,0.9991093475287482

These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-04-28,0.5,pacifier,0.16115370854727354,0.9995446723538889

The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.",2009-05-07,0.0,hair_dryer,0.25935386102555424,0.9241384442261719

As far as construction quality goes, it feels plenty sturdy.

Additionally, this peel seems to helped with oil control on my oily skin-especially when used consistently over time.     I do have a few complaints, one is the smell. Although it is not over-powering it takes a bit of getting used to, it smells like the old lanse-sa treatments at the hair salon. Another complaint is I do suffer from acne and this product seems to aggravate acne problems if used during a break-out. A word of warning, this stuff is very difficult to get out of hair so be careful where you apply it.

I brought it home, removed the older microwave this was replacing and installed this new one, myself. (Installation was a bit more difficult than I expected it to be, but this had more to do with the shoddy installation of the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit, so I won't count that as a strike against this product.)<br /><br />In the few months that we have been using this unit, there are several things that I've noticed that have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1. The glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use. I have no idea why this occured. My wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened. The glass plate was spilt into two pieces, nearly right down the middle. Weird. The replacement part cost me another $30. Not happy about this!<br /><br />2. The venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall. The hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days. This seems very irregular, as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall, not an exterior wall, and the ductwork goes up through the roof, not to the nearest exterior wall. I really don't think it should do this. The last unit did not do this, and it's a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy days.<br /><br />3. This microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn. What's up with that? Isn't that a basic necessity of EVERY microwave? Put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25% of it popped with wet, greasy kernels or 75% popped and it's all burned brown and stinky. The first few times I figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldn't figure out the new unit. Well, I have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands. For a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn, this was a real bummer, and the number one reason I would never recommend this microwave to another person.<br /><br />4. In general terms, this microwave seems underpowered. It claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced, but I'm not seeing it. Everything takes longer to cook with this unit. Sure, in microwave terms, you're only talking about 15% longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes, so it's not a lot of extra time, but it's just worse than I expected. You always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old, but that just wasn't the case, in this instance.<br /><br />5. OK, this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit. (I probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product.) I prefer microwaves that you just pop food into, press the seconds (or minutes) you want to cook something and then press start. On this unit, you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers. If you press any number at the start, the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that number button on the number pad. Some people may be used to this types of microwave. I am not, so I prefer the aforementioned method of cooking food. I don't need auto-programmed cook times assigned to my numbers.<br /><br />Overall, generally displeased with this model and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.e results with all brands.

We needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features, like most umbrella strollers. Our usual stroller is a Britax b ready, so this is a huge difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Assembly was easy- all wheels come unattached, as well as the umbrella.<br />The recline option is easy to work, no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat.<br />Handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height (5'8&#34;).

I gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead, but the brand is really a moot point for this to me. The product registration form even references that this is an Ignite model. Price point was about $15 less to go with this model vs the Ignite.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors are much more muted than pictured- I was concerned that the stroller looked girly, but honestly the colors are gender neutral.

The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It's a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you're using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!<br /><br />Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look.<br /><br />I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options 'hot', 'warm', and 'cool', and power levels 'high' and 'low', there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  'Hot' never got too hot and 'warm' was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.<br /><br />From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the 'Tourmaline Ceramic technology'.

This bear is at least twice as big as the other animals that have the attached pacifiers, making it the perfect size for an actual stuffed toy. He will pick it up off his play mat and hug it and chew on its arms or legs. Maybe when he has a bit more dexterity he'll put the pacifier in his mouth now and then. For now it is a cute, safe toy.

The reason it ripped is both my children decided to hang on it at the same time.<br /><br />I was able to repair it using dental floss and a sewing needle, then covering the sewing with duct tape to deter my little ones from trying to get to the threads.<br /><br />I will replace the broken unit with a new one of the same as soon as possible. We use this gate very heavily (10-20 times a day most days) and I think it's good that it held up this long.<br /><br />Yes, it is loud. Yes, it is possible to get it caught up while it's retracting, but overall, it's a good product. If you have an area where a regular gate just isn't s good option, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have no complaints about this product. It's perfect for areas where you don't necessarily need protection all the time, but want the option to have it. We use metal gates for the stairs, and kitchen, but we use this for the bottom of the stairs because out daughter doesn't usually have a chance to climb them without us knowing.<br /><br />It is a little more complicated to operate than a metal swinging gate, but perfect for areas where you don't have to use it all th time.",2013-08-23,0.0,pacifier,0.30373821958886305,0.7997364434283055

Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.",2007-04-01,0.8993055555555556,hair_dryer,0.2749042159044399,0.500544474320591

My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.

I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.<br /><br />I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.<br />I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!<br /><br />One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.<br /><br />Best purchase.

It does seem to dry my hair faster than other dryers, especially at the higher airflow settings.<br /><br />It is noisy (increased noise with increased speed/turbo) and it has a tendency to trip my GFI and it once contributed to blowing the circuit breaker for the outlet.

I couldn't figure out why she hated these so much, until I put it to my mouth and realized it smelled SO strong. Moreover, they get sticky really quickly, too.

I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!  Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.    I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.    I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.    I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.  I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.    Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.

I don't think most people understand difference between these and something from 99 cent store. The fact is that babies feel comfortable when eating or breast feeding and using a pacifier replicates that warmth and comfort. They cant move on their own or use toys so this provides comfort and entertainment. but the bigger issue is sucking creates pressure that can damage structure of babies mouth causing crocked teeth or cross bites. So these are worth the money and that is why after a certain age you have to stop toddler from pacifier habit when they can use other toys and objects for comfort. This pacifier helps prevent dental damage from pacifier over usage. Also it states 0-6 month so after that find another pacifier size or other toys that they will enjoy. hope this is helpful if so please click the helpful link at the bottom.,2014-08-09,0.88,pacifier,0.13352845234073388,0.9992876253479773

Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap.

So if your baby loved the hospital pacifiers but rejects the standard bulb shaped ones, this is definitely one you want to try. It is important to note that you must let the baby latch on to these just like you do with a nipple or else it will pop right back out (and may look like the baby is spitting it out). You can't just pop them in and expect them to stay like the bulb shaped ones. However once that latch is established I've found it is way more budge proof than the bulb shaped ones are.<br /><br />Another feature I really appreciate is that the handle is designed to sit flush against the base, making it less likely the baby will accidentally pull it out by the handle.<br /><br />The mouth piece is very soft and supple. The base is surrounded by a ring of silicone to increase comfort.<br /><br />My one week old newborn loves these (he loved the one he got at the hospital). He's had no issues with nipple confusion either. But that's also true of the standard bulb designs.",2014-05-21,0.5,pacifier,0.30006628911950844,0.9886003017499777

I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes (I also used the Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush).

Today I took off one star, however, because the dryer doesn't come with enough options: no styling nozzle or difuser. The settings are also very basic. So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds.

I thought the problem was my hair until I blow dried my own hair at my salon with my stylist's dryer, and it came out shiny and beautiful in so much less time.

And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1.

It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.<br /><br />It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &#34;wrong way&#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.<br /><br />The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.",2015-08-15,0.0,hair_dryer,0.8823274243438097,0.9958314233309836

The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn't feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.<br /><br />The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.

My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.

Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price.

To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older. When it drops to the floor, it doesn't bounce like the pacifier would without the kitten, so I haven't lost it in the 2 months we've been using it.",2015-03-09,1.0,pacifier,0.020359596447478145,0.06528269006577209

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",2012-12-22,1.0,hair_dryer,0.9478768148215018,0.996484662229603

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.

I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer.<br /><br />So of course, we give it five stars.",2010-11-22,0.7142857142857143,hair_dryer,0.24153107047341282,0.7382710162814186

My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling – which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called “oil-less” fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald’s, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I’d still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don’t know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It’s part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the “we’ll let you know when it will be done when we’re ready to let you know” feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

It is awfully small, awfully light, and awfully inexpensive ... however, I could say the same about the Sonicare sanitizers and those DO work!<br /><br />What surprised me was how convenient the Pipila is. It is much, much smaller than I expected (like REALLY small). Likewise, it adds virtually no weight to the diaper-bag (but, yes, its spherical construction does consume much-needed space). Conversely, for a travel item, it does seem a bit fragile (and I see numerous reports of breakage here).<br /><br />Here is my opinion: carry an extra pacifier (or two) in the diaper bag (just in case one drops on the floor) and sterilize them with your bottles at home.

Awful button placement.,"**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star). It's going back.ially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.

I was paranoid that since I was breastfeeding, that any pacifier was going to ruin things... but we were at the hospital for a test and the baby was fussing a bit and the nurse asked if we had a pacifier and I said no. She reached into the cupboard and pulled out one of these, saying they were highly recommended. We took it from her, thanked her, and threw it in the diaper bag. (We didn't try it right then because, as I mentioned, I did NOT want my baby to use a pacifier.)<br /><br />And then came a time when he was really fussy. And we had just watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and learned that Sucking is something that, ironically, PACIFIES a baby and calms them down... so I gave the baby the Soothie...and he loved it! LOVED IT! I immediately went out and bought two more 2-packs (from Target and Babies R Us). I also bought the next-stage pacifiers (one step up from newborn).<br /><br />Of course if he is super agitated (or hungry) then it won't stay in his mouth, but if he is somewhat calm already, then it's enough to keep him calm. I never thought the pacifier was too heavy, as another reviewer thought, claiming that was why it wouldn't stay in the baby's mouth. I also never thought the pacifier holder was too big. I didn't have any pacifier attachers yet, so I just bought the ones made for this pacifier and it worked just fine.<br /><br />As far as the breastfeeding worries, I continued breastfeeding for a few weeks after the introduction of the Soothie with no ill effect.",2009-04-14,0.0,pacifier,0.9997357373755069,0.12826426526885984

She loves taking naps in this and it is convenient when I am doing things on the first floor.  The changing station is wonderful and has made our lives so much easier.  We no longer have to stop what we're doing and run up stairs for every diaper change.   <br /> <br />Must admit- the music (sounds) and vibration option are rather gimmicky.  We never use these features.  Also, we took it upon ourselves to add our own mobile on the side of the unit- this provides added entertainment for our daughter while we are busy making dinner or fixing her bottle.  <br /> <br />Though she will be nearing the weight limit soon for the changing unit and bassinet features, we plan to leave it in our living room.

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.  Update on 2011-12-29: I cut my hair shorter last April and no longer use the hair dryer.

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.<br /><br />The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.<br /><br />In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.<br /><br />Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",2007-04-15,1.0,hair_dryer,0.9988635454658267,0.9347168410892687

I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable.
